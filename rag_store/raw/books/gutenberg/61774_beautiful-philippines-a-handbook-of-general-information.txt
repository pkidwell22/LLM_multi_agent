FOREWORD


It is vital for the Filipinos that foreigners visiting the Philippines
acquire accurate information about the Islands and their people. The
Philippines are not generally known abroad, much less are the Filipinos
as a people, their degree of civilization and culture, their form of
government, their institutions. Hence, the need for a publication such
as this setting forth reliable items of information about the islands.

This booklet is a compendium of facts, not fancies--facts pertaining
to the country known as the Philippines and to the people known
as the Filipino people. They are facts that can be verified from
authentic sources.

The booklet is primarily intended for tourists, but to all other
foreigners seeking information on things Philippine, the booklet
will also be of invaluable help. It not only indicates the places of
interest throughout the archipelago but also gives a description of the
islands in general, of their people, history and government. Tangible
evidences of the readiness of the Filipinos for nationality are
described. The history of the whole nationalistic movement is given.

The Filipinos to-day are in control of their own government. They have
had practical autonomy since 1916. The only remaining link between
Washington and the Philippines is the Governor-General who is an
American appointed by the President of the United States representing
his country in the islands, and is the chief executive thereof.

The islands produce great quantities of sugar, hemp, copra, rice, corn
and tobacco. They are capable of producing besides, and are actually
beginning to produce, rubber, coffee, various food and medicinal
products, and a multitude of raw materials for every purpose. There are
also many hardwoods appropriate for elegant furniture in a variety of
natural colors not yet seen in any market. There are mines of gold,
copper and coal in operation. There are said to be creditable iron
and oil deposits.

There are plenty of wonderful harbors for ships of heavy tonnage. The
country is peaceful, the most peaceful perhaps in the world. A
courteous and hospitable people greet the foreigner wherever he goes.









I. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND


[Discovery]

The Philippines were discovered by Magellan in 1521. That discovery
occasioned the first circumnavigation of the globe. Long before the
discovery, however, the Islands were already known in the Orient,
for they had commercial relations with China as early as the 13th
century and with Japan, Siam, the Malay Peninsula, Java, Sumatra,
Borneo, and the Moluccas.

It is erroneous to suppose that the culture of the Filipinos dated only
from the time of the arrival of the Spaniards. Long before that time
they had already acquired a fair degree of culture. They had systems
of writing similar to the Phoenician alphabetical arrangement. They
had calendars and a system of weights and measures. They tilled
their lands and maintained village governments. They had laws based
on traditions and customs handed down from generation to generation,
and as early as 1433, or 88 years previous to the arrival of Magellan,
there existed a Penal Code known as the Code of Calantiao.


[The Spanish Rule--A Tale of Wars and Uprisings]

The history of the Islands from the beginning of Spanish rule to the
middle of the 19th century was a long tale of wars and uprisings. The
Portuguese disputed Spain's right to the Islands, and between 1566 and
1570 made three attempts to dislodge the Spaniards. The Dutch during
the first half of the 17th century repeatedly appeared in Philippine
waters and made attacks on the Spaniards. The British unexpectedly
swooped down on Manila in 1762, and the Archbishop who was acting as
governor speedily capitulated, the City of Manila falling into British
hands until the treaty of Paris in 1763 when it was again restored
to Spain. The Chinese residents added to all these difficulties by
revolting from time to time.

But the most persistent trouble-makers were the Filipinos themselves
who repeatedly revolted because of alleged injustices committed upon
them. Between the years 1645 and 1665 alone there occurred five
uprisings against the Spanish Government. Other revolts, no less
serious, took place in the 18th and 19th centuries. The rebellion of
Dagohoy, for example, took place at this time, spreading throughout
practically the whole Island of Bohol and continuing for a period of
eighty years.

There were in all about a hundred uprisings, big and small, during the
Spanish régime. That of 1872 was especially noted for its magnitude and
the determination shown by the revolutionists. It was put down with the
execution of three secular priests--Burgos, Gomez, and Zamora--ever
since reckoned among the popular heroes of the country. From
that time plotting against the corrupt civil government and the
autocratic religious corporations never really ceased; and in 1892
Andres Bonifacio organized a secret society known as the Katipunan,
which preached hatred against Spain because of the abuses of the
friars and of the authorities, and demanded freedom from foreign yoke.


[Reforms in the 19th century]

The dawn of the 19th century, however, was marked by significant
changes for the better. During the periods of 1810 and 1813, 1820
to 1823, and 1830 to 1837, as a result of the nationalistic and
liberal struggles Spain was experiencing, the Cortes was revived
and representatives from different parts of the monarchy--the
colonies included--were given seats therein. This ushered in a
period of constitutional and representative government for the
Filipinos. Moreover, by 1830, Spain's commercial policy of trade
exclusiveness for the colonies was abandoned. A few years later,
Manila was thrown open to foreign trade and a freer and more liberal
economic system adopted. In this way, the foundation for subsequent
political and economic progress was laid.

From the beginning of Spanish domination, there existed scores of
schools and colleges which were mostly conducted by the religious
orders. These schools and colleges offered various courses and
graduated numerous priests, lawyers, physicians, pharmacists,
and teachers. Increase in the number of professional graduates
made possible the rise of an intellectual class in the seventies
and eighties. To this group of men, Burgos and Paterno, leaders
of the liberal movement of 1870; Dr. Rizal, the Filipino hero;
M. H. del Pilar, a prominent propagandist; and Mabini, the brain
of the Revolution, belonged--men who, in attainment and culture,
can adorn the halls of any nation. Many of the prominent leaders of
today also had their training in those schools--Manuel L. Quezon,
Sergio Osmeña, T. Pardo de Tavera, Victorino Mapa, Florentino Torres,
Teodoro M. Kalaw, Juan Sumulong, Rafael Palma, and many others who
have held high positions in the government during the first years of
American sovereignty.


[Last Decades of Spanish Rule--The Coming of the Americans]

The last decades of Spanish rule were marked by several reforms,
but these reforms were altogether too conservative and came too
late. Consequently there was much discontent and the Filipinos,
in August, 1896, following the teachings of the Katipunan, rose in
revolt and sought to declare themselves independent of Spain. The
revolution extended throughout the archipelago. It was halted by the
Pact of Biac-na-Bato in December, 1897, only to be resumed early in
the year following, under the very eyes and later with the help of the
Americans, who appeared on the scene on May 1, 1898. The Filipinos
succeeded in wresting from Spain every foot of Philippine territory
except Manila which was surrendered to the Americans on August 13,
after simultaneous attacks by American and Filipino forces.

Soon afterwards the first republic in the Far East based on a
constitutional and representative government was established by the
Filipinos. It had received the commendation of several foreigners
among whom were the late Senator Hoar and John Barrett, ex-Director
of the Pan-American Union.


[Filipino-American War]

The downfall of the republic came as a result of the Filipino-American
war which broke out through a misunderstanding between America and
the Philippines and which lasted for three years. With the superior
forces of the United States it was naturally a one-sided struggle,
but it nevertheless showed once more the determination of the Filipino
people to have an independent national existence. They wanted no less
than an untrammeled republic free from any foreign control. They asked
that of the United States. But no definite assurance was given that
they would ultimately be freed. Had such assurances been given them
the Filipino-American war would have been avoided.


[The Establishment of civil government]

American civil government was established in the Islands in 1901
and 1902. Under this government the Philippines made remarkably
rapid strides along the road of progress. But the most significant
stride is perhaps the development of Philippine home rule, For it
should be known that today, with few exceptions, notably those of the
American Chief Executive and the American Vice-Governor, who is also
Secretary of Public Instruction, the Philippine government is run by
the Filipinos themselves.









II. THE MATERIAL SPAIN FOUND


[Power of Propaganda to Misrepresent Conditions]

So powerful is propaganda in misrepresenting actual conditions that
the Philippines used to mean, and often still means, a mere fringe
of civilization, or something similar to it, where the Spaniards
had planted and the Americans had watered, but within all was still
savagery and primeval ways.

An exhibition of an Igorot village at the St. Louis World's Fair of
1904 probably spread in America more of the notion of the Philippines
as an untamed wilderness than tons of statistics could correct. These,
then, were the people America had undertaken to govern--wild, naked
creatures, beside whom the North American Indian was a gentleman and a
scholar! Indeed, a long time must elapse before you can reduce these to
suspenders and beefsteaks. A long time? Why, centuries and centuries!


[Non-Christian population]

Again, to the assiduous readers of press dispatches, the typical
Filipino has come to mean the fierce Mohammedan Moro; although, there
are in the Islands less than 400,000 Mohammedans of all kinds, whether
fierce or urbane. Still others have concluded that the wild-eyed nomad
of the mountains, the man with the bow and arrow, with no religion at
all, must be the determining factor of the situation because there are
so many of his kind; and yet the census reveals the total number of
persons in all the Islands that do not profess either Christianity,
Mohammedanism, or Buddhism as only 102,000.


[Literacy]

So, too, the ignorance of the Filipinos has always been believed to be
appalling and a bulwark of darkness not to be overcome in generations,
if ever; and yet the census reveals the percentage of literacy in the
entire Islands at 49.2 per cent. The percentage compares favorably
with the literacy of many of the small independent nations of the
world at present.

The facts are these, as regards the Filipinos even in Pre-Spanish days:


[Facts of Filipino Attainments in Pre-Spanish Days]

The Spaniards found that the inhabitants of the Islands built and
lived in planned houses, had a machinery of government of their own,
maintained a system of jurisprudence, in many cases dwelt in ordered
cities and towns and practised the arts familiar to the most advanced
peoples of their times.

Gunpowder they knew and used before 1300, when it had not yet
been introduced in Europe; and they made firearms that astonished
the Spaniards. At the siege of Manila, 1570, the natives defended
their city with cannon, and the conquerors found within the walls
the factory where these guns had been forged, as well equipped and
ordered as any abroad.

The Islanders were expert in other metal-working, skilful
ship-builders, able carpenters. Copper they had worked; but bronze,
of which their great guns were made, they imported from China. Some
of their art in silver-work excites admiration even now, for their
beautiful design and fine workmanship.

They wove cloths of cotton, hemp, and other fibers. They were, in fact,
inheritors of two great cultural infiltrations upon what original
culture the Malays had two thousand years before: on one side, was
the influence of the Hindus and on the other the civilization of the
Chinese, and to these had been added, years before the Spaniards came,
stray gleams of information transmitted roundabout from Europe.


[Religion, alphabet, and books]

All this is inconsistent with the fanciful theory of the head-hunter
and the wild man of the woods, but is nevertheless the incontestable
record. Heathen they were called, but they had a religion,
and a code of morals, not at all contemptible. They were natural
musicians, possessed a variety of musical instruments, and had native
orchestras. They were fond of poetry and and honored their poets. They
had also a written alphabet and they wrote books. Every settled
town had a temple and most temples had collections of books. They
were written in the native characters on palm leaves and bamboo,
and stored with the native priests. The subjects were historical and
legendary, folk-lore tales, statutes, deeds of heroism and poems. The
Spanish enthusiasts burned these books as anti-Christian and thereby
destroyed documents priceless to succeeding ages, the few that escaped
the flames testifying poignantly to the great loss. A small collection
of them was recently discovered in a cave in the Island of Negros and
ethnologists have hopes of others that may have escaped the sharp
eyes of the destructors. Professor Beyer, whose investigations of
early Filipino life and history have been so extensive, has come upon
other evidence of early Filipino letters, including an epic poem of
considerable length; but this exists now only in the memories of the
reciters. The four-thousand-odd lines of it that Professor Beyer has
translated show a rare gift of versification and imagery.

Of the written alphabets in use before the coming of the Spaniards,
fourteen were of Malay origin, one was Arabic, and one Hebrew. Of
the Malayan alphabets many were structurally alike, so that a learned
Visayan must have been able to make out Tagalog words and a Pampangan
to spell Ilocano. We are not to imagine that every Filipino could
read the written speech; there were in the Islands at that time,
as in India, Spain, England, and elsewhere, the educated and the
uneducated. But it seems likely that the percentage of literacy in
the Philippines, about the year 1500, let us say, was as large as in
Spain, larger than in India and compared favorably with the percentage
in other places.


[Traders and artisans]

The inhabitants were able traders as well as skilful artisans. Manila
was one of the great commercial centers of the East and long had
been so; it was not a mere collection of fishermen's huts. When the
inhabitants of England were wearing skins, painting their bodies, and
gashing their flesh in religious frenzies, the Filipinos were already
conducting commercial marts in which were offered silks, brocades,
cotton and other cloths, household furniture, precious stones, gold
and gold dust, jewelry, wheat from Japan, weapons, works of art and
of utility in many metals, cultivated fruits, domesticated animals,
earthenware, and a variety of agricultural products from their rich
volcanic soil.


[Able Agriculturists]

The people understood how to make agricultural implements which,
if crude by present standards, were nevertheless serviceable. They
knew how to make machines, to hull and separate rice, to express oil
from coconuts, and to weave their cloths. They worked out their own
problems of irrigation and in their own way. The huge rice terraces in
some parts of Luzon were and still are the wonder of all beholders. "I
know of no more impressive examples of primitive engineering," says
Dean C. Worcester, "than the terraced mountain-sides of Nueva Vizcaya
beside which the terraced hills of Japan sink into insignificance."




WRITTEN AND UNWRITTEN LAWS.--The people had both written and unwritten
laws. They were made and promulgated by the chiefs after consultation
with the elders, and were "observed with so great exactness that it
was not considered possible to break them in any circumstance."

The laws covered many of the subjects which are common in modern
times. A few of the most striking points were: Respect of parents
and elders, carried to so great a degree that not even the name of
one's father could pass the lips, in the same way as the Hebrews
regarded the name of God. Even after reaching manhood and even after
marriage, the son was under a strict obligation to obey his father and
mother. Marriage had reached the stage of mutual consent. Marriage
ceremonies approaching the religious were elaborate, according to
rank. Husband and wife were equal socially and in the control of their
property. Property was acquired principally by occupation, but also by
gift, purchase, and succession. Wills were sometimes made. Contracts
were strictly fulfilled. The Chinese writer, Wang Ta-yuan; in a book
of 1349 says: "The natives and the traders having agreed on prices,
they let the former carry off the goods and later on they bring the
amount of native products agreed upon. The traders trust them, for
they never fail to keep their bargains." In fact, non-performance of
a contract was severely punished. Partnerships were formed and the
respective obligations of the partners enforced.


The Code of Calantiao.--The penal law was the most extensive. Penalties
were severe, altho compared with present laws, they appear cruel and
illogical. However, they compared favorably with Greek and Roman laws
as well as with the contemporary Spanish and English criminal laws.

Calantiao, the third chief of Panay, had, in 1433, promulgated a
penal code. It ran as follows:


   "Ye shall not kill; neither shall ye steal; neither shall ye do
    harm to the aged; lest ye incur the danger of death. All those
    who infringe this order shall be condemned to death by being
    drowned with stones in the river, or in boiling water.

   "Ye shall obey. Let all your debts with the headmen (principales)
    be met punctually. He who does not obey shall receive for the
    first offense one hundred lashes. If the debt is large, he shall
    be condemned to thrust his hand thrice into boiling water. For
    the second offense, he shall be condemned to be beaten to death.

   "Observe and obey ye: let no one disturb the quiet of graves. When
    passing by the caves and trees where they are, give respect
    to them.

   "Ye shall obey: he who makes exchange for food, let it be always
    done in accordance with his word. He who does not comply, shall be
    beaten for one hour, he who repeats the offense shall be exposed
    for one day among ants.

   "They shall be burned: Those who by their strength or cunning have
    mocked at and escaped punishment; or who have killed young boys;
    or try to steal away the women of agorangs (rich men).

   "Those shall be killed who profane sites where idols are kept,
    and sites where are buried the sacred things of their diuatas
    (spirits) and headmen."


[Testimonies of Occidental Writers]

All which bespeak a culture of no mean order, and occidental writers
themselves have given it the credit that it deserves, as shown by
the following testimonies:


   "They had already reached a considerable degree of civilization
    at the time of the Spanish conquest."--Professor Ferdinand
    Blumentritt.

   "The inhabitants of these Islands were by no means savages,
    entirely unreclaimed from barbarism, before the Spanish advent
    in the sixteenth century. They had a culture of their own."--John
    Foreman.

   "The inhabitants of the Philippines possessed a culture of their
    own prior to the coming of the Spaniards to the Islands. Those
    along the coasts were the most advanced in civilization. Their
    material wealth was considerable. The chief occupations were
    agriculture, fishing, weaving, some manufacturing, and trade
    both inter-island and with the mainland, generally in the form of
    barter. They were expert navigators. They used standard weights
    and measures. The year was divided into twelve lunar months. They
    had a peculiar phonetic alphabet, wrote upon leaves, and had a
    primitive literature. The majority of the people are said to have
    been able to read and write."--Justice George A. Malcolm.

   "The inhabitants practise various kinds of industry; they weave
    matting of extraordinary fineness and of the brightest colors,
    straw hats, cigar-cases and baskets; they manufacture cloth and
    tissues of every sort from leaves of the aguana, make cambric of a
    texture much finer than that of France; and they also manufacture
    coarse strong cloth for sails, etc.; and ropes and cables of all
    dimensions; they tan and dress leather and skins to perfection;
    they manufacture coarse earthenware and forge and polish arms of
    various kinds; they build ships of heavy tonnage and also light
    and neat boats, and at Manila they frame and finish off beautiful
    carriages; they are also very clever workers in gold and silver
    and copper; and the Indian (Filipino) women are especially expert
    in needlework and in all kinds of embroidery." (Twenty years in
    the Philippines, pp. 304, 307.)


PROGRESS DURING SPANISH RULE.--The Spanish rule in the Philippines
lasted 350 years. The Spanish Crown meant well, but the way her
policies were translated into deeds was all but desirable. The best
men could not be induced to go to Manila. The Church wielded tremendous
power, and at times was more powerful than the government itself. Each
village was under the rule of a priest. Character was stifled; progress
was deliberately discouraged; independence of thought stamped out.

It would be doing Spain a great injustice, however, if no credit
whatever is given her rule in the Philippine Islands. She introduced
Christianity into the Islands and unequivocably converted the
inhabitants to the creed, thus setting up the only Christian country
in this part of the globe with a Christian outlook on life; in the
women, particularly, the tenets of Christianity instilled dignity
and it freed them from Hindu and Mohammedan degradations.


[Schools and Colleges]

Efforts were also taken to teach the people the rudiments
of education. Access was thus given to the splendid tongue of
Castile, and, thru that, to all the glories and traditions of Latin
civilization. As early as 1866, for a population of 4,000,000 people,
there were 841 schools for boys and 833 for girls. In 1892, six years
before the coming of the Americans, there were 2,137 schools. There
were also colleges and universities where professional training
was given. The colleges were: University of Santo Tomas, Manila,
established in 1611 (twenty-five years older than Harvard); San Juan
de Letran, Municipal Athenaeum, Normal School, College of San Jose,
the Nautical School, the School of Commercial Accounting, the Academy
of Painting and Drawing, and many other private schools, fourteen
of which were in Manila. There were also seminaries in Manila,
Nueva Segovia, Cebu, Jaro, and Nueva Caceres, where all branches of
secondary instruction were taught in addition to those prescribed
for the priesthood.

Many of the prominent Filipinos in Philippine history, as stated above,
including the national hero, Jose Rizal, had their first instructions
in these schools established by Spain.


[Filipino Record Abroad]

A number of the ambitious students were sent by their parents
to complete their education in Spain, France, England, Belgium,
and Germany. Groups of these young men took part in the various
liberal movements of nineteenth century Europe. They wrote and
spoke in behalf of liberal institutions for the Islands, in terms
that would have cost them their lives in the Philippines; in fact,
Rizal was put to death upon his return to his native land. Several of
these young Filipinos even rose to eminence in the public service,
a right which was denied them at home except in a few cases in the
minor judiciary. In the eighties and nineties, a group of them of
which Rizal, Juan Luna, Resurrección Hidalgo, M. H. del Pilar, Lopez
Jaena, Pedro A. Paterno, and Dr. Pardo de Tavera were the leading
spirits--made a deep impression in the literary and artistic circles of
Madrid, Paris, and Berlin. A newspaper was founded by them in Madrid to
further their political views. Although proscribed in the Philippines,
their books and articles were circulated secretly in the Islands and
helped to arouse the people and to consolidate the growing unrest.


Opinions of Foreign Authors.--On Spain's achievements in the
Philippines, foreign authors have been considerate. The famous French
explorer of the Pacific, for example, La Perouse, who was in Manila
in 1787, wrote:


   "Three million people inhabit these different islands, and that
    of Luzon contains nearly a third of them. These people seem to
    me no way inferior to those of Europe; they cultivate the soil
    with intelligence, they are carpenters, cabinet-makers, smiths,
    jewelers, weavers masons, etc. I have gone through their villages
    and I have found them kind, hospitable, and affable." ("Voyage
    de la Perouse autour du Monde," Paris, 1787, II, p. 347.)

   "Almost every other country of the (Malay or Indian) Archipelago
    is, at this day, in point of wealth, power, and civilization,
    in a worse state than when Europeans connected themselves with
    them three centuries back. The Philippines alone have improved in
    civilization, wealth, and populousness. ("History of the Indian
    Archipelago," by John Crawford, F. R. S. Edinburgh, 1820, Vol. ii,
    pp. 447, 488.)


The Austrian professor, Ferdinand Blumentritt, wrote in La Solidaridad
of October 15, 1899, to this effect:


   "If the general condition of the civilization of the Tagalos,
    Pampangos, Bicols, Bisayans, Ilocanos, Cagayanes, and Sambales
    is compared to the European constitutional countries of Servia,
    Roumania, Bulgaria, and Greece, the Spanish-Filipino civilization
    of the said Indian districts is greater and of larger extent than
    of those countries."


And the foremost American scholar on the Philippines, gives the
following résumé of the results of the Spanish administration:


   "The Spaniards did influence the Filipinos profoundly, and on the
    whole for the better. There were ways, indeed, in which their
    record as a colonizing power in the Philippines stands today
    unique in all the world for its benevolent achievement and its
    substantial accomplishment of net progress. We do not need to
    gloss over the defects of Spain; we do not need to condone the
    backward and halting policy which at last turned the Filipinos
    against Spanish rule, nor to regret the final outcome of events,
    in order to do Spain justice. But we must do full justice to her
    actual achievements, if not as ruler, at any rate as teacher and
    missionary, in order to put the Filipinos of today in their proper
    category." (Le Roy: "Philippine Life in Town and Country," 1905,
    pp. 6, 7.)


[The Background on Which America Had Built]

It was on all that cultural background--the native and the
Spaniard--that America had built. Without belittling what she, alone,
has done for the Filipinos since 1898 it hardly can be disputed that
the rapid progress towards modern democracy in the Islands has been due
mainly to the materials she found there. This fact has made her task
a great deal easier, and is the reason why even the early military
governors thought best to preserve the old municipal institutions
with very slight changes.









III. THE FIRST PHILIPPINE REPUBLIC


The earlier revolutions against Spain were actuated by well-defined
causes. They have been summarized as follows:


[Causes of Earlier Revolutions]

(1) Denial of freedom of speech and press; (2) desire for Filipino
representation; (3) proceedings by which a man was condemned without
being heard; (4) violation of domicile and correspondence on mere
secret denunciations; (5) agitation for the secularization of parishes;
(6) political and civil equality for Filipinos and Spaniards; (7)
desire for promulgation of the Spanish Constitution in the Philippines;
and (7) the martyrdom of Burgos, Gomez, and Zamora, and later of Rizal.


[The Revolution of 1896]

The revolution of 1896, however, had an additional cause which was
dominant in the minds of the leaders. It was "Liberty, Equality,
and Fraternity." In the words of General Aguinaldo in a manifesto,
"We aspire to the glory of obtaining the Liberty, Independence,
and Honor of the Country."


[The Pact of Biac-na-Bato]

This revolution was halted in 1897 by the Pact of Biac-na-Bato,
which was signed between the Revolutionists and the Spanish
authorities. There were three outstanding stipulations in the pact:

First, that the Filipino leaders should leave the country for the
time being.

Second, that liberal and sweeping reforms would be introduced without
delay.

Third, that the sum of $800,000 would be paid the Filipinos in two
instalments, as evidence of good faith.

The Filipinos complied with their part of the agreement; Aguinaldo and
his followers went to Hongkong. But the Spaniards did not comply with
theirs; only $400,000 was paid to the revolutionists and no reforms
were introduced.


[The Republic]

Accordingly, Aguinaldo and his companions returned to the Islands
and renewed the struggle. On June 12, 1898 at Kawit, Cavite, they
proclaimed the Independence of the Philippines from Spain. Soon
afterwards a Philippine Republic was ratified, with General Aguinaldo
as President. The capital was established at Malolos about 30 miles
from Manila. There an elective Congress sat regularly, passed laws,
levied taxes, administered revenues, kept in motion the machinery of
justice, directed a military organization, carried on efficient war
and constantly appealed to the patriotism of the people.


[Governmental Machinery Set Up]

A complete governmental machinery was set up. The government was
declared to be "popular, representative, and responsible." Church
and state were made separate, and, profiting by the experience of
the past, freedom of religious worship was expressly recognized in
the Constitution. The powers of government were made to reside in
three distinct entities--the legislative, the executive, and the
judicial, to be entirely separate. It was declared that no two of
these powers should be vested in a single person or corporation,
nor can the legislative power be conferred on a single individual
alone. The government was recognized throughout the islands and had
the wholehearted support of the entire population.

At the time America insisted in imposing her sovereignty and authority
not only were the Filipinos in military control of the country; they
were administering its political affairs as well. This they did from
the establishment of the Republic until the autumn of 1899. "Up to
that time," writes Albert G. Robinson, of the New York Evening Post,
"the territory occupied by the forces of the United States in the
Island of Luzon was confined to a very limited area in the vicinity
of Manila, with a filamentary extension northward for some fifty
or sixty miles along the Manila-Dagupan railway. Very much the
same condition obtained on the other islands. One thing is certain:
although greatly disturbed by the conditions of war, this territory
was under some form of governmental administration."




THE MALOLOS CONSTITUTION.--The fundamental law that had been prepared
and adopted by the independent government has since then been known as
the "Malolos Constitution." This Philippine Magna Carta embodied the
advanced thought of the times and was replete with sound principles. It
had all the requisites of a "fundamental law of the land"--an
enumeration of individual rights, the organization of the state
and of the government, provisions pertaining to the public welfare
(such as education, appropriation, the militia, local government,
impeachment, etc.) and provisions for constitutional revisions.


[Salient Features]

The Parliamentary System of government was adopted as best suited to
the needs of the archipelago. Sovereignty was to reside in the people
through their duly elected representatives. The aim throughout was to
adopt a government and a social order essentially democratic, without
those privileges of caste or classes which were the determinant causes
of the revolution. The popular assembly was to be the directing power.

The following progressive principles were enunciated:

(1) That no one should be tried in courts created by private laws or by
special tribunals; (2) that throughout the republic there should not be
more than one kind of court for all citizens both in civil, criminal,
and military actions; (3) that no person or corporation should be given
emoluments that were not as compensation for public service fixed
by law; (4) there shall be no primogeniture nor should decorations
and titles of nobility be accepted; (5) that every Filipino citizen
shall enjoy the right of meeting, association, petition, and liberty
of the press; (6) freedom of religious worship throughout the land and
inviolability of domicile, correspondence, and property; (7) the right
of habeas corpus; (8) gratuitous and compulsory public instruction;
(9) taxes to be in proportion to the income of the taxpayers.

The legislative power was vested in an unicameral assembly. The
representatives elected by the people were to be representatives of
the entire nation and could not bind themselves to specific mandates
from their constituents.

The President of the republic and the Assembly were to initiate laws.

Impeachment of high officials of the government was unhesitatingly
made a part of the fundamental law. Even the President of the republic
could be impeached in cases of high treason.

A permanent commission was created to take the place of the assembly
during recess, the motive behind its creation being that legislative
bodies should be permanent because the popular will works continually
and consequently should be continually represented in the governmental
machinery.

The permanent commission was to be composed of seven members elected
by the assembly from among its members. Its powers were:

(1) To declare if a certain official of the government should be
impeached; (2) to convene the assembly to an extraordinary session in
cases in which it should constitute itself into a tribunal of justice
to consider impeachments; (3) to resolve all pending questions with
a view to bringing them before the assembly for consideration; (4) to
convoke the assembly to special sessions whenever these are necessary;
(5) to substitute the assembly in its power regarding the. constitution
with the exception that the permanent commission can not pass laws.

The executive power was vested in the President of the Republic who
exercised it through his secretaries.

The President of the Republic was elected by the constituent assembly
by an absolute majority of votes. His term of office was four years
but might be reëlected. The powers of the President were expressly
enumerated. The secretaries of departments constituted the Cabinet,
presided over by the President. There were seven departments--foreign
relations; interior; finance; war and navy; public instruction;
communications and public works; agriculture, industry, and commerce.

Ministerial responsibility was established so that whenever a cabinet
had lost the confidence of the majority of the assembly its members
were morally bound to resign.

The judicial power was vested in a supreme court and in such other
tribunals as might be created by law. The judiciary was made absolutely
independent of the legislative and executive departments. The chief
justice and the attorney-general were appointed by the Assembly with
the concurrence of the President and of the cabinet.

Provinces and municipalities were given administrative autonomy. The
central government intervened in their acts only when they over-stepped
their powers to the prejudice of general or individual interests.

A Constituent Assembly was to be convened in case of an election
of the President of the Republic and whenever there were proposed
changes in the constitution. In either of these two cases the regular
assembly was dissolved by the President and the Constituent Assembly
convoked. The constituent assembly was to be composed of the same
members of the regular assembly plus special representatives.

Such was the framework of the governmental machinery created by the
first republican constitution ever promulgated in the East. In the
words of General Aguinaldo, the Constitution was "the most glorious
note in the noble aspirations of the Philippine revolution and is
an irrefutable proof before the civilized world of the culture and
capacity of the Filipino people to govern themselves."


Comments of Foreigners.--The comments of unbiased foreigners on
this ill-fated attempt of the Filipino people to live an independent
existence all point to the fact that the Republic together with the
constitution the independent government had established was a great
work of an unquestionably able people.

John Barrett, ex-director of the Pan-American Union, saw the Philippine
Republic in operation, and described it as follows:


   "It is a government which has practically been administering
    the affairs of that great island, 'Luzon' since the American
    possession of Manila, and is certainly better than the former
    administration. It had a properly formed Cabinet and Congress,
    the members of which, in appearance and manners, would compare
    favorably with the Japanese statesmen."


Admiral Dewey, after studying Philippine conditions, during the
Spanish-American War, spoke of the Filipinos as follows:


   "In my opinion, these people are far more superior in intelligence
    and more capable of self-government than the natives of Cuba. I
    am familiar with both races."


General Merrit, on his arrival in Paris in October, 1898, was reported
as saying:


   "The Filipinos impressed me very favorably. I think great injustice
    has been done to the native population.... They are more capable
    of self-government than, I think, the Cubans are. They are
    considered to be good Catholics. They have lawyers, doctors,
    the men of kindred professions, who stand well in the community,
    and bear favorable comparison to those of other countries. They
    are dignified, courteous, and reserved."


Leonard Sargent, a naval cadet, and W. B. Wilcox, paymaster of the
Navy, after travelling over the Island of Luzon, at that time wrote
a report of their trip, which was referred by Admiral Dewey to the
Navy Department with the indorsement that it was "the most complete
information obtainable." Mr. Sargent remarked:


   "Although this government has never been recognized, and in all
    probability will go out of existence without recognition, yet,
    it cannot be denied that, in a region occupied by many millions
    of inhabitants, for nearly six months, it stood alone between
    anarchy and order.

   "As a tribute to the efficiency of Aguinaldo's government and
    to the law-abiding character of his subjects, I offer the fact
    that Mr. Wilcox and I pursued our journey throughout in perfect
    security, and returned to Manila with only the most pleasing
    recollections of the quiet and orderly life which we found the
    natives to be leading under the new régime."









IV. POPULATION OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS


[A Homogeneous People]

The Filipinos are a homogeneous people. An American, Dr. Merton Miller,
former chief ethnologist of the Philippine Bureau of Science is the
foremost authority for the claim that:


   "From the extreme northern end of the Archipelago to its
    southernmost limits, with the exception of the few scattered
    Negritos, the people of the Philippines, pagan, Moro and Christian
    are one racially. There is some reason for believing that they
    migrated into the islands at two different times. But in all
    probability they came from the same general region and have a
    common ancestry.

   "There are many different languages or dialects in the Philippines
    but all are closely related one to another, the pronunciation
    and mode of speech vary but little from one section of the
    Philippines to another and the majority of the words are common
    to two or more of the Philippine languages. These languages,
    whether spoken by pagan, Moro or Christian, belong to the great
    Malayo-Polynesian family, branches of which are found in Sumatra,
    the Hawaiian Islands, Madagascar and on many islands between."


Ex-President Taft has the following to say about Filipino homogeneity:


   "The word 'tribe' gives an erroneous impression. There is no
    tribal relation among the Filipinos. There is a racial solidarity
    among them undoubtedly. They are homogeneous. I can not tell the
    difference between an Ilocano and a Tagalog or a Visayan.... To
    me all the Filipinos were alike."


While Governor General Harrison, before a joint committee of Congress,
expressed himself thus:


   "To my way of thinking, they are very remarkably homogeneous,
    quite as much so as any nation in the world to-day with which
    I have any acquaintance. From one end of the Philippine Islands
    to the other the people look very much alike; their manners are
    very much the same; their style of living is about the same;
    and they are being generally educated along the same lines by
    the government and by the private schools, which are coöperating
    with the government. So that I think they already have one of
    the prime requisites to a nationality, namely, a general and
    universal feeling that they belong to the same race of people."


[Total Population]

The total population of the Philippine Islands according to the
Census of 1918 is 10,350,640. Of this number 9,495,272 are Christians,
while 855,368 are non-Christian so-called. The non-Christian element,
therefore, represents 8.2 per cent of the total population. In this
number are included the Mohammedans of the South and the Igorots and
other mountaineers, who have been so widely advertised abroad and
often represented as typical Filipinos.

V. GEOGRAPHICAL ITEMS OF INTEREST


The Philippine Archipelago is entirely in the Tropics. They lie north
of the Dutch and British Island of Borneo and the Dutch Island of
Celebes; South of the Japanese Island of Formosa; East of French
Indo-China, and Southeast of Hongkong and the Southern provinces
of China.


[Number of Islands]

There are 7,083 islands in all extending 1,152 statute miles from
north to south and 688 statute miles from east to west. Two thousand
four hundred and forty-one of the Islands have names, while 4,642
are unnamed. The northernmost Island known as Y'Ami Island is 65
miles from Formosa while the southernmost, called Salwag, 4° 40'
from the Equator, is only 30 miles east of Borneo.


[Total Land Area]

The total land area of the entire archipelago is approximately 115,000
square miles. This is in excess of the combined areas of the States
of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware; only about
7,000 square miles less than the total area of the British Isles;
about 5,000 square miles more than the total area of Italy; and about
two-thirds the size of Spain. Luzon Island alone which is the largest
is as large as Denmark, Belgium, and Holland combined. It contains
46,969 square miles. Mindanao, the second largest, is about equal in
area to Portugal. Ten islands contain more than 10,000 square miles
each or 6,400,000 acres; while 20 of the islands have between 100 and
1,000 square miles each. About seven-eighths of the total number of
islands composing the Archipelago contain less than 1 square mile each.


[Bays and Straits]

There are twenty-one fine harbors and eight land-locked straits. Manila
Bay with an area of 770 square miles and a circumference of 120 miles
is reputed to be the finest in the Far East. It is said that it can
accommodate the entire fleet of the world. It is a roadstead, in all
parts of which vessels can anchor. Manila, Cebu, Iloilo, Zamboanga,
and Jolo are at present the ports of entry.

The interisland waters are shallow, averaging between seventy-five
and five hundred fathoms.


[Mountains]

There are at least seven principal mountain ranges and twenty more
or less active volcanoes. Mount Apo in Mindanao is the highest being
9,610 feet. Canlaon in Negros is second with 7,995 feet; Mayon in
Albay third, with 7,943 feet.


[Rivers]

Nearly all the principal islands have important river systems. In
Luzon are the Rio Grande de Cagayan, 220 miles long, which drains
16,000 square miles of territory, the Rio Grande de Pampanga,
emptying into Manila Bay through a dozen mouths, the Agno, the Abra,
Bued, and the more familiar Pasig. The Rio Grande de Mindanao, 330
miles long, is the largest in the Islands, and the Agusan, also in
Mindanao, is the third in size. Mindoro has 60 rivers and Samar,
26. In Panay, are the Jalaud and Panay and in Negros the Danao and
the Lanao. Inter-island steamers berth in the Pasig as far as the
Jones Bridge. The larger rivers, in addition to being navigable for
steamers and launches of light draft for distances of from 20 to 200
miles, could furnish abundant water power for manufacturing purposes.


[Lakes]

Mindanao, especially the basin of the Agusan, has a vast number of
lakes, among them the famous lakes Lanao, Mainit, and Lagusan. Laguna
de Bay, near Manila, Lake Naujan in Mindoro, Taal, and Bombon lakes
in Batangas, and Lake Bito in Leyte are also noted for size and beauty.


[Falls]

The Falls of Pagsanjan and the Botocan at Majayjay, in Laguna Province;
the Maria Cristina, the Pigduktan, and Kalilokan, in Mindanao, are
the largest and most beautiful.


[Mineral Springs]

Some 170 or more medico-mineral springs, hot and cold, are known in
the Islands, many rivaling the most famous of Europe and America. Near
Manila are those of Los Baños, Sibul, Lemery, Tivi, and Marilao.


[Climate]

Father Algué, the world famous Director of the Weather Bureau,
divides the climate into three types, the classification being based
on distance above sea level and exposure to ocean breezes.

November, December, January, and February are the temperate
months. The mean average temperature at this season is about 77° to 79°
Fahrenheit. In April, May, and June, the hot months, the mean average
is between 83° and 84°. In other months it is about 80°. The nights
are seldom unpleasantly hot even in the hot season, and a temperature
of 100° is a rarity in Manila. The mountain regions of the north are
cool as September in the temperate zone. The mean average maximum
for Baguio is 80° and the minimum 53°. Far south, nearer the equator,
in some localities it is hotter; but Zamboanga and the Provinces of
Bukidnon and Lanao boast a most agreeable and healthful climate.

The climate is thus mildly tropical. Sunstrokes are unknown. The
recorded death rate per 1,000 whites in Manila for 1917 was 8.8, as
compared with 16.5 for New York, 15 for San Francisco, 14 for Chicago,
18 for Glasgow, and 22 for Belfast.


                          DIFFERENCES IN TIME

            Manila is in advance of:
                London             8 hours and 3 minutes.
                New York           12 hours and 59 minutes.
                San Francisco      16 hours and 11 minutes.
                Washington         13 hours.

VI. THE CITY OF MANILA


[Entrance to Manila Bay]

You enter Manila Bay thru a narrow passage in the middle of which is
the famous Island of Corregidor, the "Rock," the "Gibraltar of the Far
East," the "Home of the Big Guns," that guards the harbor. It is also
a hydroplane station of the United States. The island is a stalwart
sentinel, as it were, at the harbor's mouth. Nearby are two other
"watch dogs" of Uncle Sam, known as "El Fraile" and "El Carabao,"
two other well fortified islands holding many a surprise for any
invading fleet.

Down the bay your steamer glides amid the shipping of many nations
and the launches of the customs and quarantine soon appear to "look
the stranger over."




MANILA.--After the quarantine and customs inspection you get off
your steamer and you are in Manila, the capital of the Philippine
Archipelago. Your first impressions are of the tourist sort. Your
interest is immediately arrested by the dress and habits of the
Filipinos, of the Chinese, and of the various residents from every
quarter of the globe. The water buffalo or the carabao, the one horse
carriage, or the carromata, and the slippers, or "chinelas," worn in
the streets by the poor will startle you to the realization that you
are in a world other than your own. The every-day clothes worn by the
people give you an ensemble of all the colors imaginable, more so when
there is a procession, parade or similar festivities--royal purple,
plum, heliotrope, magenta, psolferino, scarlet, geranium, salmon,
pinks, greens, vivid and tender, all the blues, yellow, orange,
champaca, in short every hue, shade, and tint that art has borrowed
from nature or has invented.

You stroll around the City and one of the first things you notice
is the various means of transportation. There is the automobile,
from the popular Ford Lizzie to the Packard Limousine; there is the
one-horse carriage, in shape and looks unique in the world; and there
is the street car propelled by the familiar electricity.

The Walled City.--Near the pier you see a cluster of buildings
enclosed by solid stone walls about twenty feet high. This is the
famous Walled City or Intramuros, a remnant of Spanish days. It is
something less than a mile long and half a mile wide. The walls used to
be fortresses with which the Spaniards used to repel the many attacks
and invasions. To go into this Walled City is to remind you of Madrid,
Spain, with all its narrow streets and typical Spanish buildings. The
walls had been begun prior to the end of the sixteenth century;
before the next was far advanced, the place boasted of a cathedral,
hospitals, and a university; walled Manila had grown into quite a city.

The Walled City is the original Manila, of which every other part of
the modern city is, historically speaking, a suburb. Its battlemented
wall is a little over 2 1/2 miles in circuit, and is still for the
most part in an excellent state of preservation. The age of the walls
is hard to state; its oldest existing portions were undoubtedly built
before the end of the sixteenth century, but it has been continuously
patched and added to, almost up to the present generation. Parts of it
are from twenty to thirty feet in height and thickness. Considering
everything, it makes this district one of the best examples of a
mediæval walled town in existence.


[Fort Santiago]

While in this Walled City, do not fail to visit Fort Santiago, the
oldest part of Spanish Manila, long the citadel of the city, and now
the headquarters of the United States Army in the Philippines. It
probably stands very nearly on the site of the native fort which the
Spanish reconnoitering expedition carried by assault in 1570. It
has undergone comparatively little external change in three
centuries. There are plenty of traditions connected with the old
place--stories of cells below the river level for the "unintentional"
execution of inconvenient persons, and of chambers found filled with
dislocated skeletons. Though none of these places are now identifiable,
it is a historical fact that one cell, either in the fort or in the
wall to the east of it (since removed), was the scene, as late as the
night of the 31st of August, 1896, of a tragedy much resembling that of
the Black Hole of Calcutta. Fifty-six out of sixty Filipinos who had
been crowded into it, on being arrested on suspicion of complicity
in the insurrection then raging, were the victims of the poisoned
atmosphere or of the desperate struggle that took place within.

Pursuing your travels around Manila you see an admixture of the
quaintly native, of the mediæval, and of the strictly modern. In
architecture, you see splendid examples of Grecian, Moorish, Spanish,
Renaissance, Gothic, and Byzantine. Likewise you see many native nipa
houses, small yet cool and cozy, and exceedingly appropriate for the
needs of the climate.


[Three Manilas]

For in reality there are three Manilas, which are still
noticeable. First, there is the Manila of the original Malay, which,
with its nipa shacks, its carabaos, and its quaint fishing boats,
exists much as it did in the days of Raja Lacandola. Secondly,
there is the Manila of the sixteenth and seventeenth century
Spaniard--adventurer, merchant, and crusader in equal parts--who, in
the churches and convents, the walls and gates, and the half-Moorish
domestic architecture, has left ineffaceable memorials of the fact
that this, the oldest of the European settlements in the East, was in
its day among the chief glories of the "once imperial race." Finally,
there is the Americanized Manila of to-day, the town of electricity,
motor cars, macadamized roads and sewers and steel bridges, well on
its way to become one of the beautiful cities of the world.


[Costumes]

The costumes of the women are admittedly unique and attractive. Old
Spain gave the peasant's neckerchief that has evolved into the pañuelo;
the court train of her damas gave the saya; her priests gave the
tapis; the ground plan is Malayan, the sleeves swelled to suit the
climate. This, which has changed but little in over three centuries,
is the predominating model; but America, Paris, half Asia, and the
South Pacific contribute also to the revue des modes: georgette crèpe
and coconut fiber rain cape and skirt, white duck and rengue, all in
the same rain shower on the same block.


[The Shops]

Modern shops with plate-glass fronts, office buildings with their
elevators, elbow in between the open-fronted Chino shops of the
Rosario. And the carabao snails by, and the "little gray hawk" that
"hangs aloft in the air," happens to be an aëroplane.


[The Pasig]

Down by the entrance to the Pasig River modern steamers are warped
to the river wall, and farther up dumpy river launches shuffle about
their work of conveying to the big household of Manila chickens,
pigs, fruits, and vegetables; a string of bamboo-roofed cascoes lie
in wait by the market; sturdy bargemen with thirty-foot bamboo poles
shove the unwieldy lorchas about, and the tiny bancas now toddle
bravely along, now reel and wobble from the cuffs of their elders. The
river is navigable for miles, and a trip upstream reveals successive
combinations of meadows, high banks fringed with feathery bamboo,
and here and there a village with its nipa houses and its gray stone
church embowered in groves of coconuts and mangoes.




OTHER PLACES OF INTEREST

[Churches]

You will find them at every turn. To see her churches alone, in
detail--St. Augustine's, built in 1599, with its ceiling of solid stone
nearly four feet thick, and the illustrious dead beneath its hardwood
floor; St. Sebastian's of solid steel made in Belgium and brought out
in sections and assembled; St. Ignatius' and others with exquisitely
carved woodwork, the work of Filipinos; their altars, statues and
paintings--to appreciate their architecture and the engineering skill
that erected them would require not days or weeks, but months.


[The Cathedral]

Special mention should be made of the Cathedral, the historic edifice
which has witnessed so many rare and brilliant ceremonies. It is
a most ornate and yet harmonious structure. The massive dome can
be seen from far out at sea. The nave of the cathedral is of most
majestic proportions and its pillars and clusters, with their gilded
capitals, are handsome. The cupola rises to an immense height and has
an inside balcony. Its four corners are frescoed, and the subjects
are the "Four Evangelists." A beautiful sky, with angel heads, upon
which stands the statue of the Immaculate Concepcion, is just above
the high altar and around it, in sort of a frieze, are the heads of
the apostles, while in the transepts, are the heads of the prophets,
kings, and patriarchs. The architecture of the cathedral is of Roman
Byzantine Style.


[The Ayuntamiento]

On the right hand side of the cathedral, the traveler sees the
Ayuntamiento, a two-story building, the original seat of the Spanish
government, now the headquarters of the House of Representatives and
of the six departments of the Philippine government. The cornerstone
of this building was laid in 1735. On the main landing of its imposing
staircase is a statue, a replica of that in the "Biblioteca Nacional"
at Madrid, of Juan Sebastian Elcano, the navigator who, after the death
of Magellan, brought to a safe conclusion the first voyage around the
world. The doors in either side of the statue lead to the Marble Hall,
named from its marble floor, where the house of representatives sits
and where official receptions and state entertainments are often held.


[University of Santo Tomas]

In the rear of the Ayuntamiento, and occupying the other half of the
same block, stands the building of the University of Santo Tomas,
founded in 1619, the oldest educational institution of collegiate
rank under American sovereignty. It is under the direction of the
Dominican Order and has departments for the education of students
in all the principal professions. It keeps a valuable and extensive
collection of zoölogical, ethnological, and other scientific specimens
which is open to male visitors only (the university being by origin a
monastic institution) on Sunday mornings from 9 to 11. In the little
plaza on which the building fronts is a statue of Miguel Benavides,
the second Archbishop of Manila, and founder of the University.


[The Dominican Church]

At the end of this plaza stands the great Gothic Dominican Church,
one of the very few examples of that style in the city. It has very
fine doors and a beautifully decorated altar and pulpit. Connected
with it, as with all the old churches of the friar orders, is an
enormous convent, very plain outside, but containing much of interest
within--ancient libraries and some very quaint courtyards, cloisters,
refection halls, and a series of religious pictures.

Just back of this church is the gap in the wall, thru which the car
line from the commercial center of the city enters. Hard by is the
Intendencia Building, in which is located the Insular Treasury and
the offices and session hall of the Philippine Senate. Behind this,
on the river front, is a modest monument to Magellan, the one memorial
of the great discoverer in the capital of the land he brought in
contact with Latin civilization.


[Avenues]

The Walled City, except for a short space where the battlements of
Fort Santiago are washed by the river, is completely surrounded by
fine avenues, all bordered on the inside by the stretch of green which
has replaced the former moat. The Magallanes Drive runs for a short
distance between the walls and the Pasig river to the northeast. To
the west is the Bonifacio Drive, with an avenue of palms. This is
now bounded on its farther side by the new Port District, but in old
days was the seaside promenade of Manila. The circuit of the wall is
completed by the Bagumbayan Drive (now Burgos Drive), which sweeps
in a beautiful acacia-bordered quadrant around the east, southeast,
and south.

This avenue will, in a few years, be completely lined with Government
buildings and grounds. It begins at the river, near the end of the
Jones Bridge. Continuing down it toward the bay the traveler passes
first the Mehan Gardens, really a public park, of moderate size,
finely kept. It was the result of the work of a Spanish botanist and
forester, Sebastian Vidal y Soler, of whom a statue stands in its
midst. The garden was completely neglected and used as a camping
ground during the insurrection, but was restored by the present
Government. Beyond the garden in succession, are the buildings of
the Bureau of Printing and the present temporary City Hall. The
street branching off to the left between these is Calle Concepcion,
on the right hand side of which, immediately back of the City Hall,
are the buildings of the Young Men's Christian Association.

Turning to the left from the riverside of the Botanical Garden and
crossing the Pasig River on the Santa Cruz Bridge, then turning to the
right, the traveler comes across another important and imposing avenue,
called the Rizal Avenue. This avenue begins from the heart of the
commercial district of the city, and leads to the northern suburb of
Manila, which is destined to be one of the best residential sections.

The principal attractions on this avenue, are the Grand Opera House
where periodical performances are held by foreign opera companies,
the Stadium where prize fighting is held between Filipino boxers as
well as between Filipino and foreign boxers, the Central Methodist
Church, and the San Lazaro Hospital.


[Bilibid Prison]

This avenue is intersected by an equally broad thoroughfare formed by
Azcarraga Street, on which are numerous small shops, several theaters
of various grades, and several residential homes. On the sea-side of
this thoroughfare is situated the Cathedral of the Independent Filipino
Church, an institution headed by Archbishop Aglipay, and having about
3,000,000 members. Other places of interest are the Zorrilla Theater,
the Centro Escolar de Señoritas, a private school for girls, being
the biggest institution of the kind in Manila, and Bilibid Prison,
the great central penitentiary of the Philippines and one of the
largest and best-managed institutions of the kind in the world.

The average number of inmates of Bilibid Prison is between 2,500 and
3,000. The main part of the prison, which altogether covers twenty
acres, consists of well-ventilated wards radiating from a central
tower; cells are little used. There is a fine hospital, a school,
and a highly developed system of industries. Visitors are admitted
everyday for the ceremony of retreat, which occurs at about 4:30 in
the afternoon. The salesroom, where the products of the prison shops
may be seen and purchased, are open to the public during the regular
office hours. Perhaps the best work is to be found in the furniture of
native hardwood; but the wicker furniture, the desk sets, and other
small articles of hardwood, the silverware, and the local curios are
well worth inspection.


[Taft Avenue]

Another wide and picturesque avenue branches off from Burgos Drive,
a short distance from the City Hall. This is called the Taft Avenue,
after the first civil governor of the Philippines, Honorable William
H. Taft, now Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Along
this avenue are several modern concrete buildings, the most important
of which are the Philippine Normal School, the Normal Hall, a dormitory
for ladies, the Santa Rita's Hall, the Central School for American
and European children, the Nurses' Home, and the Philippine General
Hospital.

Turning to the right, on Padre Faura Street, the traveler comes across
a number of the buildings of the Philippine University, all of which
are of reinforced concrete and modern in every respect. The large
vacant space behind these buildings is the University Campus where
athletic exercises and military drills are held almost every afternoon.


[Central Observatory]

Further on to the left on this same street, is the Central Observatory
of the Philippine Weather Bureau. This intensely interesting
institution is open to the public on Tuesdays from half past 2 to
half past 4 in the afternoon and on Saturdays from half past 8 to
half past 11 in the morning. It is one of the oldest and best of
its kind in the East, having been founded in 1865 by the Jesuits
and operated continuously since then, even in 1898, while hostile
armies were contending for the possession of the city. The founder
and director for many years was Fr. Frederic Faura, after whom the
street on which the building stands is named. The present head is
Fr. Jose Algué, who has made for himself a world-wide reputation
as a meteorologist. It is still directed by specially trained Jesuit
priests and supported financially by an arrangement with the Philippine
Government. Its great renown has been gained through its work in the
field of earthquakes and typhoons.


[The Luneta]

At the extreme end of Burgos Drive, the traveler comes out on the
broad expanse of a park, of partly natural and partly made land, on the
inland side of which is the most famous recreation place of Manila--the
Luneta. This is an oval stretch of lawn where, nearly every evening,
the music of the fine band of the Philippine Constabulary or that
of some military organization combines with the sea breeze and the
gorgeous sunsets behind the top of Mount Mariveles to bring together
a crowd so varied and brilliant as to make this gathering one of
the most distinctively picturesque sights of the city. Hundreds of
carriages and motor cars draw up along the curb or make the circuit
of the driveway, while thousands of pedestrians throng the walks and
lawns. It is a gay and cosmopolitan gathering--Government officials,
wealthy Chinese merchants, Spaniards, officers of the Army and Navy,
American women in the light and dainty gowns of the Tropics, and
Filipino women of every class in the picturesque national dress of
gorgeous semi-transparent native cloth, that has caused one observer
to describe them as "jet-crowned butterflies."

On the green of the Luneta facing Manila Bay is the monument to
the national hero of the Philippines--the physician, novelist,
and patriot--Dr. Jose Rizal. It was designed by the Swiss sculptor
Richard Kissling, whose work was selected out of many in a contest
for a substantial prize. The monument consists of a granite obelisk,
about fifty feet high, serving as a background for a bronze statue
of heroic size.


[The Manila Hotel]

To the north of the Luneta is the well-known Manila Hotel, reputed to
be the finest in the Orient. Immediately opposite the hotel site, on
the green at the corner of the former moat, is the monument to Miguel
Lopez de Legaspi and Andres Urdaneta, the civil and ecclesiastical
founders of Manila. This, as a work of art, is far superior to
anything else of the sort now actually standing in the city. The
pedestal supports idealized figures of the mailed warrior and the
priest, holding aloft the banner of Castile and the Cross. These
were cast in Spain and sent out prior to the change of sovereignty,
but was never put up. They were found by the American conquerors in
a warehouse, and it is to them that the monument owes its erection
in its present excellent location. On the side of the green opposite
the hotel and the Legaspi monument are the new buildings of the Elks
and the Army and Navy Clubs.


[The Museum]

To the north of the Manila Hotel is the Philippine Museum, housed in
a modern building. Those interested in the fauna and flora of this
part of the globe, and in archeological collections will find in this
museum an hour well spent.


[The Carnival Grounds]

To the East of the present Luneta, immediately across the road, is the
large tract of land known as Wallace (formerly Bagumbayan) Field. It
is the site of athletic grounds and of the annual Carnival. It boasts
a gruesome past and a distinguished future. Under the old régime it
was a public execution ground for political prisoners, and here on
the 30th of December, 1896, in the shadow of the old Luneta outwork,
since removed, Dr. Jose Rizal met his death before the Spanish firing
squad. In a few years more, under the name of "Government Center," it
will be the site of the new Capitol, and of other Government buildings.

For the present this tract is the scene, for a week or more every
February, of the great Philippine Carnival, which has become one of
the established institutions in the Islands and one of the greatest
attractions of Manila. While it lasts most of the town puts on
festal garb and takes a series of half holidays, and dominoes become
familiar sights on the public streets. Within the grounds are the
usual amusement features--the merry-go-round, the whip, shooting
galleries, a hippodrome with spectacular performances, and extensive
and interesting exhibits of the products of the Islands, sent by the
provincial governments, the schools, and private concerns. Elaborate
parades--military, industrial, and carnival--and great balls in
an immense auditorium, both exclusive and popular, complete the
program. The industrial and commercial exhibits are under the
supervision of the Government.


[Dewey Boulevard]

Capping the ensemble of all these attractions around the Luneta is a
beautiful boulevard, comparable with the best anywhere, which leads
from where the buildings of the Elks and the Army and Navy Clubs are
situated and extends until the city limits, near Pasay, a suburb on
the Manila South Road. This boulevard is a favorite driveway in the
evening. The chain of lights that illuminate its entire length makes
it attractive beyond comparison. To the right will be heard the splash
of the waters of Manila Bay dashing against the rocks that fringe the
Boulevard. To the left are some of the most imposing residences of
the City. The steamers anchored in the bay present a lovely sight,
especially in the stillness of the night. It is from this boulevard
that the Philippine sunset, so entrancingly beautiful, can be seen
without obstruction, while in the distance, to the left, is the City of
Cavite, to which the Boulevard will in time lead, and hence has been
originally named "Cavite Boulevard." It was only recently that its
name was changed to "Dewey Boulevard" in memory of Admiral Dewey who,
a short distance out into the bay, by defeating the Spanish Squadron,
sealed the fate of colonial Spain in this part of the globe.


[Clubs and Societies]

All of the great fraternal orders have their branches in Manila--The
Masonic Order, The Knights of Columbus, The I. O. O. F., The Elks,
and The Knights Templars. Religious, charitable, social, musical,
literary, athletic, and other associations, also abound. There is a
National Federation of Women's Clubs, having about 400 branches in all
parts of the Archipelago and also a Catholic Federation of Women. All
the foreigners also have their respective clubs and societies.


[Cemeteries]

The Cementerio del Norte is the municipal cemetery. It is the only
modern garden cemetery in Manila. It covers a very large area (133
acres), only a small part of which has been developed. There are
sections for Americans, Filipinos, and Chinese, each showing the
distinctive emblems with which the several races mark the resting
places of their dead. There are beautiful monuments and well-kept
lawns.

Adjoining the municipal cemetery is the Catholic cemetery and the
chapel of La Loma. The Chinese also have an exclusive cemetery
nearby. All the ground in this vicinity is historical, for much of
the fighting of the early days of the insurrection centered about
the district; there was a block-house which formerly stood back of
the La Loma Chapel. Paco cemetery on San Marcelino is closed now,
but once a year, on All Saints Day, it is opened and in the evening,
brilliantly illuminated.


[Monuments]

Among the most notable monuments are the Rizal monument in the Luneta;
the Legaspi and Urdaneta monument near the Manila Hotel; the Anda
monument at the foot of the Malecon Drive; the Magallanes monument
near the Treasury building; the Statue of Elcano in the Ayuntamiento;
the Statue of Benavides at Plaza of Sto. Tomas; and that of Charles IV
at Plaza McKinley, and Queen Isabela II in Malate. The finest of the
recent ones, are the monument of Balintawak, a short distance out,
to commemorate the first cry of the revolution, and the monument to
the Katipunan and the Liga Filipina at Raxa Matanda, Tondo.




LIFE IN MANILA.--In Manila is felt the pulse of the world's
activity--the currents of political, commercial, and intellectual
thought of the world--more keenly than in New York or London. The
reason is simple. Each man here is an individual machine; in the larger
cities he is a cog. The elements of absolute economic dependence
being absent, the inhabitants are forced into contact with many
nations, together with all the social and economic relations which
that contact entails. In the press Manila is not overwhelmed with a
mass of unimportant news. The immensity of non-essential topics of
no general interest is spared the residents. Only the essential and
all the essential reaches them. Their horizon is not bounded by 42nd
Street nor by neighbor Peet's farm. One of the many reasons for the
happier life in Manila than in other cities of the world, so far at
least as foreigners are concerned, is the natural selection of the fit
and strong, which is invariably taking place. There are no crippled
and weak, no poor nor invalid people in Manila to pester you. They do
not come--they seldom dare. Only those looking for adventure, those
fitted to care for themselves, those determined to survive that come
to make this part of the world his temporary or permanent abode.


[No Vexing Conventionalities]

The conventionalities and prescribed forms of daily living are
absent. There is no Madam Gruncy to hector, there are no rules
of the elite class or the would-be Four Hundred. You come and
go unquestioned. You have absolute sovereignty over your own
affairs. There are no neighbors to tell the foreigner what to think
or how to vote. Neither a Democrat nor a Republican is disgraced for
being so. A society of men and women from all corners of the globe
accord respect to your judgment. Not living in San Francisco you are
not disturbed by its claims of superiority to Seattle or New York.

There is less attention paid to inconsequential details and boresome
routine than in the complex centers of the Old and the New World. It is
of less importance to know what Lady Jane wore at the ball than to know
how she will run her embroidery establishment. More thought is given
to one's failure and success and struggles with new conditions than
of a man's politics. The interrelationship of races, the development
of a virgin country, the wide latitude for one's activities accustom
you to thinking in the large. Men talk little in the Tropics, but
what they say has meaning.

There is less violence in the Philippines than in any other land. The
people are gentle and courteous. In provincial towns, in lonely
districts, an American or European woman can remain alone for days
without fear of molestation. One can take long trips through the
wildest mountain in perfect safety. Firearms for self defense need
not even be thought of.


[Competition Less Severe]

Competition in Manila is not as severe as in other cities. Success
is attained with greater ease. The routine of life is pleasant,
and days pass quickly. In occidental cities one generally rushes
through breakfast and rushes to his office. Also he rushes all the
morning until 12 o'clock. Not so in the Philippines. He dictates in a
few minutes his day's correspondence which will probably leave port
a week later, depending on the schedule of boats. Then he has new
schemes to think over and conferences to hold with confrères. After
this there is usually considerable time for ice cream and further
conferences outside. He probably visits his bank and the cable office,
and does some more thinking. If he is a salesman, he has to talk
with prospective customers. At all events he is a very busy man,
with a dozen plans for expansion working in his brain; but there
is time, aeons of time. There is so much to be done and so little
danger that the field will be overworked before he gets to it that he
fears nothing. At 12 o'clock or thereabouts he goes back to his room
for lunch. Afterwards he sleeps for two hours and drops back to his
office. At 4 o'clock he goes out for tea, and at 5 o'clock, if the
day has been a hard one, he knocks off for golf or tennis or a swim,
or goes back to his siesta chair for rest. After supper at 8 o'clock,
if he is socially inclined, he organizes a party for a cabaret and
spends a pleasant evening. Otherwise he plays cards or billiards
at his club. The next day repeats, and so on. He is never hurried,
never tired, never worried.









VII. THE ENVIRONS OF MANILA


On the outskirts of the City of Manila, lies one of the most beautiful
scenic routes in the tropics--the expanse of country extending from
the city itself to what is known as the Montalban Water Works, in
Rizal Province, from which the city derives its water supply. At the
head of a picturesque gorge, the Mariquina River is impounded by a dam,
and the water is brought to the City of Manila, 39 kilometers distant,
through aqueducts of cast iron.

The ride to the gorge through the heart of the Mariquina valley, one
of the most fertile regions of the Island of Luzon, is a veritable
scenic fairyland. Lowland, mountain, hill, stream, field, bridge,
road, village, and town combine to form a landscape that invariably
fascinates the visitor. The scene is restful and pleasing to the eye
at almost every vista that presents itself.

Crossing the Ayala Bridge and passing through General Solano Street,
the visitor proceeds on his way to the famous valley. On both sides
of General Solano stand old Spanish residences practically as they
were in the days of the Spaniards. This was then the fashionable
residential section of the city and its glories as such have not as
yet entirely departed.


[The Malacañang Palace]

Soon, the Governor-General's palatial home known as the "Malacañang
Palace," is reached on the right, immediately after the only brewery in
the City of Manila. The palace is beyond doubt the finest residence in
the islands. The gardens are particularly well-kept, Governor-General
Harrison having improved the residence and the grounds making it a
sumptuous and fitting place for the first executive of the land.

Immediately next to the Governor's palace is the executive building
housing the offices of the Governor-General's staff and cabinet. It
is an elaborate structure decorated with hardwood carvings.

After a detour to drive thru the grounds of the palace, the visitor
proceeds on his way towards Santa Mesa. The next place of interest
is known as the "Rotonda"--a circular Plaza at which two important
thoroughfares and some of lesser importance intersect. In the center of
the Rotonda stands the Carriedo Fountain built in memory of Francisco
Carriedo, the Spanish engineer who installed the first gravity water
system in Manila sometime in the 19th century.


[Santa Mesa]

Soon the visitor arrives at another residential section known as
Santa Mesa. This section is on top of a hilly district overlooking the
city. Fine bungalows and villas surrounded by beautiful lawns adjoin
one another. Americans, Europeans, and Filipinos live here side by
side. Mingled with the sumptuous abodes found in this section are
several patches of nipa huts, furnishing a startling contrast--the
almost primitive native residence common throughout the archipelago,
especially in the barrios, as compared with the architecturally highly
developed occidental type of residence. In the midst of this ensemble
of residences are rice fields cultivated in typical native fashion
with terraces, ditches, carabaos, etc.


[San Juan Bridge and Heights]

The visitor now comes across a country that is more open, and
cultivated patches of land become a more frequent sight. In a few
minutes, he reaches the famous "San Juan Bridge," a historical
landmark. It was here, on February 4th, 1899, that the first shot
of the Filipino-American war was fired. Two days later, the treaty
of Paris ceding the Philippines to the United States was ratified,
and the Filipinos continued to revolt.

After crossing the bridge, the visitor reaches San Juan Heights,
a suburban development project in the municipality of San Juan del
Monte. Less than two years ago, an enterprising American formed a
company and divided this property up into lots and started selling
the parcels on the instalment plan. The project was a success and now
a good sized community has settled on this district. Other parcels
of land in the vicinity have been similarly divided into lots, and
Manila suburban property is now rapidly undergoing development in
the familiar American manner. Among these other parcels are the San
Juan Heights Addition, the Rosario Heights, and the Magdalena Estate,
the latter being an immense tract of land extending for several miles
into the country.


[The Reservoir]

Nearby is located the distributing reservoir of the Manila Water
Supply system, called "El Depósito." It was constructed in Spanish
days, but has now grown to be entirely too small for the ever-growing
needs of the city.

Along the side of the reservoir is the "Boys' Reformatory School,"
where wayward and recalcitrant youngsters are won back to good
behaviour and useful life at the expense of the city and the Insular
government.

Turning back to the main roadway, the visitor sees the palatial
residence of the Ex-Mayor of Manila, now Senator Hon. Ramon Fernandez.


[The Mariquina Valley]

From this point on, there is an entirely rural scenery, an immense
plain bounded by mountains in the north and east. This is the Mariquina
Valley. Somewhere on this valley just outside the municipality
of San Mateo, was the spot where General Lawton was shot by the
Filipino insurgents. This whole region was intensely fought over
by the contending forces, the Filipino insurgents retreating to the
mountains to the north and east.


[The Town of Mariquina]

Soon afterwards, the town of Mariquina is reached. It is a typical
Filipino community. Proximity to the Philippine metropolis does not
seem to have altered its appearance in the least. It has a rural air
and atmosphere and the people evidently belong to the hard-plodding
farmer-class.

An excellent road makes driving a pleasure through the Mariquina
Valley. The combination of colors and light, tropical vegetation
and houses, the undulating mountain divides, the brilliant green
of the palms and bamboo, contrasted with the intense verdure of the
rice fields, present a vista that can be expressed adequately only
by painting.


[The Payatas Estate]

After Mariquina comes the town of San Mateo, centrally situated in the
Mariquina Valley. It was here that tenants of the vast Payatas Estate
in the vicinity combined and bought the property from the Japanese
owners three years ago. The enterprise was the first cooperative
agricultural Filipino effort on a large scale and has proved to be
a success. The purchase price was $775,000, and all of this amount
but $100,000 has been paid up.


[At the Dam]

Then the dam is reached. It is in the town of Montalban, 35 kilometers
from Manila. The road winds in and out along the banks of the river,
the banks of the river themselves become steeper and steeper, and
soon the towering white limestone sides of the Mariquina gorge loom
up several hundred feet, and the reservoir inclosure is reached.

Those who desire to go as far as the dam must be sure to obtain
permits from the Metropolitan Water District before leaving Manila,
otherwise the trip will have to end at the head of the deep gorge at
the gate of the reservoir. With such a permit the visitor is allowed
to enter the reservoir gate and he proceeds up the shaded walk to
the dam and reservoir.

The walk to the reservoir is only a few minutes, up a well-kept path
lined with shrubs, trees, and flowers with the rushing water of the
river below to the left.

The reservoir, surrounded by the green mountain sides, makes a pretty
picture reminding the visitor of some of the descriptions of lakes
in the Scottish Islands, as depicted by Sir Walter Scott in some of
his works.


[Different Return Route]

The return to Manila may be made by way of Pasig, the capital of the
Province of Rizal, after leaving Mariquina where the roads branch. On
this way back, Fort Wm. McKinley is worth visiting. It is said to
be the largest army post under the American flag and one of the best
administered. It cannot fail to impress the visitor because of its fine
buildings, spacious parade grounds and attractive officers' quarters.









VIII. OTHER CITIES


BAGUIO

[Baguio]

Baguio, which is often called the Simla of the Philippines, is classed
with even more famous mountain resorts by its admirers. By automobile
it is about eight hours' ride from Manila. By train and passenger
trucks combined, it is about eleven hours.

The Benguet road is the most traveled route. It leaves the lowlands
at Dagupan and now ascends, now crosses and recrosses the gorge of
the Bued River, coiling back on itself in the famous Zig-zag, where
the inspirations of Baguio's natural wonders begin. Cooler and cooler
grows the air, behind drops all the lowland vegetation, to make room
for sturdy trees of the temperate zone. Wave on wave the trees roll
up the mountains that stand on each other's shoulders below, around
and above the small tableland on which Baguio edges away from the
sheer precipice at the head of the gorge.

For some years a summer capital to which the Government transferred
its work and personnel during the hot months, it is a chartered city,
but the all-year residents are few, though many of the well-to-do of
Manila have summer homes there. It has two hotels and several cottages
for visitors.

No one may know the Philippines adequately without visiting this, the
temperate beauty spot of the Archipelago. Pure forest-scented air,
cooled by lofty peaks and a city that is well laid out representing
what is best in the Islands' civic progress are the outstanding
"strands in the fabric of Baguio's attractions." Here is a fairyland
of green--gardens, beautiful walks, and easily accessible peaks
commanding exquisite vistas of valleys and neighboring mountain tops.


[Camp John Hay]

Camp John Hay, the military hospital post, is the main show place,
among its beauties being the open air amphitheater that General Bell
built with mountaineer labor, terraced as their wonderful rice terraces
are, and gay with flowers.

Other places to see are the Mansion House, the official summer
residence of the Governor-General; Bishop Brent's School for American
children and the School for mountain girls; the Constabulary School;
the rest houses of the different religious Orders; Mirador, the
Observatory, and Mt. Santo Tomas, whence a glorious view may be had
over the whole majestic panorama of mountains and valleys to the
lowlands and to the China Sea. On horseback or afoot, in Baguio and
its immediate environs, just enjoying the air, the roses, the pungent
pines, the tree ferns, the fields of Benguet lilies, every day is a
delight. But beyond lie more regions that beckon.


[Trinidad Valley]

The strawberries and green peas at Trinidad, where are the Government
stock farm and agricultural school, extend an occidental welcome to the
visitors. On the mountain train to Bontoc the rest houses with their
big open fire places are just like homes in the temperate zone. The
great orerich valley of Amburayan lies on one side of the divide;
on the other is the Lepanto basin with Cervantes in the cap of the
hills. Sagada and Lubuagan are easy of access by side roads and trails,
but to reach Tawang and Balbalan means difficult and proportionally
interesting and exhilarating going through magnificent forests of
cedar, from one rancheria to another. At Banaue are rice terraces
nearly a mile in height. Generation after generation has toiled to
build them. The mission stations with their schools where the young
folks are taught modern trades and perfected in their own handicrafts
are heart-warming evidences alike of Christian love and charity and
self-sacrifice and grateful appreciation of the mountain peoples and
their eagerness to join their brethren of the lowlands in the full
light of civilization.

Descending on horseback in a westward direction one comes to Butac,
and a telephone message will bring an auto to whisk one on the Tagudin,
the sea outlet of the Mountain Province, that has a Belgian convent
noted for its laces and embroideries. The train or an auto will
convey the traveler thence north to the extreme end of Luzon and
back down the coast of Manila. The great North Road, that follows
the sea most of the way, is a scenic route for its entire length,
and along or near it are interesting old towns to visit, such as
Laoag, San Fernando, which offer delightful sea bathing, Vigan,
Paoay, San Vicente, and Bangui, where the Ilocano weavers, carvers,
and potters can be watched at their fascinating tasks.




CEBU

[The City of Cebu]

Cebu, the metropolis of the Visayan Islands, is the oldest European
city in the Philippines and one of the oldest occidental settlements
in the East. Discovered and temporarily occupied by Magellan in 1521,
it became a permanent Spanish possession in 1565, having thus almost
exactly the same age as the other Spanish settlement, St. Augustine,
in Florida. It is situated about midway of the east coast of the island
of the same name. The island itself is practically coextensive with
the Province of Cebu, of which the city is the capital. The province
has the largest population of any in the Archipelago and is one of
the most thickly inhabited. The city has a good harbor, protected
by the Island of Mactan, and the scene which unfolds itself from
the moment of entering the channel, between this Island and that of
Cebu proper is a very busy one. There are good harbor facilities,
and seagoing vessels of large draft are able to tie up along the docks.

Cebu is a fascinating mixture of old and new and contains a
considerable number of places of special interest. The waterfront is
busy with the various activities arising from the city's position
as one of the chief centers of the Islands' hemp trade. Here is a
good opportunity to see the finest grades of this important staple,
of which the Philippines have practically a monopoly.


[Places of Historic Interest]

Most of the places of historic interest are within a short distance of
this point. Calle Colon, the oldest street in the Islands, is in this
city. On the main plaza is a small building housing a large hollow
cross. This contains within it another cross, which, according to the
most probable story, is the original one erected to mark the spot where
Magellan and his companions gathered for the first mass on Philippine
soil. But a short distance away is the old triangular Fort San Pedro,
standing approximately on the site of Magellan's fortifications; and in
the same neighborhood stands the Augustinian church and convent. Here
the sacristan will show to visitors the curious image known as the
"Holy Child of Cebu." It is agreed by historians that this is the
one which was given by Magellan in 1521 to the temporarily converted
wife of the rajah of Cebu, and recovered forty years later after the
landing of Legaspi.

An automobile road through the Province of Cebu gives a pleasing
succession of views of the sea through arcades of coconut palms that
fringe the long narrow island of Cebu; a second road cuts across its
backbone, giving finer views still.




ILOILO

[The City of Iloilo]

The City of Iloilo is the sugar port. It is situated on the east coast
of the Island of Panay, along the lower reaches of the river whose
name it bears, and is about 300 miles from Manila, in a direction
a little east of south. It is one of the most important ports of the
Philippines and carries on with Cebu an amiable contest for the dignity
of ranking as the second city. It has direct shipping connections
with Europe, the Straits Settlements, China, Japan, and Australia;
and there are many boats sailing to other portions of the Archipelago,
including a regular service to Cebu. There are banking institutions
and a number of importing and exporting houses, and the local trade
reaches up into high figures. Substantial walls have been built along
the river, where large steamers can unload. Ships of greater draft
anchor in the harbor, where they are well in shore and protected.

Near it are two towns of considerable historic interest--Jaro and
Molo. A railroad runs through the province and its neighbor Capiz, thus
making it easy to see a considerable portion of the Island of Panay,
which is made up of the provinces of Iloilo, Capiz, and Antique. There
are the white coral cliffs near Ventura, honeycombed with caves,
with interesting legends attached to them, as is the case with one
having its outlet in Dumalag, Capiz. The stone church at Miagao has
the most quaintly carved facade in the Islands. The hand weaving of
the delicate textiles jusi, piña, and the like is one of the leading
industries of Iloilo Province.




ZAMBOANGA

Zamboanga in Mindanao is the capital of the whole Moro Province and
one of the most important ports in the Islands. Its population is
very cosmopolitan--an admixture of Moros, Filipinos, Orientals, and
Caucasians. The city was for more than three centuries the rallying
point of the Christian forces in their seemingly endless contest with
the Moro pirates in neighboring waters.

The city has a healthful site and is cooler than Manila. It has a
modern water system and electric lighting plant. It is well laid
out and maintained in park-like order for some distance back from
the pier. This area, where many of the principal buildings are, is
embellished by fountains and lily basins, ornamental stone and concrete
seats and figures and an almost complete collection of the flowering
and other ornamental trees, vines, and shrubs of the Philippines. The
Provincial Capitol, the Army Post, and Constabulary Headquarters,
the old fort of Nuestra Señora del Pilar and the Cathedral, and the
Moro market are the most interesting to inspect. Nearby is the Moro
village of Kawa-Kawa, built out over the water.


[The San Ramon Penal Colony]

In the outskirts there are several points of interest reached by
excellent roads--the gorge, which has some beautiful mountain and
river scenery, about five miles distant; the San Ramon Penal Colony
about thirteen miles from the city where an experimental farm is
being maintained. In addition to these attractions its position with
respect to Borneo, Australia, the Dutch possessions, and the Malay
Peninsula gives it great potential importance as a trade center.









IX. THE PROVINCES--BEAUTY SPOTS


The Philippine Archipelago is a compact group of islands. The distances
between each island require only a few hours of sailing. They therefore
have been said to possess strategic unity. From the northernmost
port, Aparri, to the southernmost Zamboanga, the total distance is
895 miles. It takes only 36 hours from Manila to Aparri and about 72
from Manila to Zamboanga. With faster boats, the time required will
be much less.

In each island the provinces and the important towns are easily
accessible. They are connected by good roads. In the bigger islands
the Manila Railroad operates lines, such as in Luzon, Cebu, and Iloilo.

The trip through the provinces should be taken whenever
possible. Barring the usual discomforts of a tropical clime, there are
delights galore for everyone, even for the hardy sportsman--pristine
forests, crystal streams, splashing falls. The panoramas that unfold
as the traveler motors from province to province or cruises about
from island to island present a continuous series of scenic pictures
of infinite variety. In other lands nature and man have combined
their efforts in forming recreation spots of compelling charm. In
the Philippines it is only nature that has done the work.

The services of a guide should in all cases be secured in order to
expedite the visits. Applications for guides should be made to the
Director of the Bureau of Commerce and Industry.


LAGUNA PROVINCE.--The Province of Laguna is situated on a narrow
plain which lies to the east, south, and southeast of Laguna Lake,
commonly known as Laguna de Bay. It is a very fertile province and has
a very pleasant climate, the usual temperature being several degrees
cooler than Manila. It produces coconuts, rice, sugar-cane, abaca,
corn and a great variety of fruits and vegetables.

In industrial enterprises the province is very progressive. Some of
the largest kind of hemp cables are made in the rope factory of Santa
Cruz. Buntal hats and pandan mats are made in Majayjay and Luisiana,
pandan hats in Cavisti, Sabutan hats in Mavitac, rattan chairs in
Paquil and Los Baños, wooden slippers in Biñan and Calamba, and abacá
slippers in Lilio. Furniture is also made in Paete, soap in Santa
Cruz, crude pottery in Lumban, better grade of glazed pottery in
San Pedro Tunasan, coconut wine in the upper towns, and embroidery
in Lumbang. Mineral waters are bottled in Los Baños, Pagsanjan, and
Magdalena. A steam saw mill is located in Santa Maria. In Los Baños
is a stone quarry that supplies crushed stone for the Provinces of
Bulacan, Rizal, Cavite, Batangas, and Tayabas.

The province, besides having a rich soil, has an abundance of water
supply. The Laguna de Bay, the largest lake in the Philippines, permits
of easy and cheap transportation. Fifteen of the 28 municipalities
are reached by water and a line of steam launches provides a daily
service between the lake and the city of Manila. The lake abounds
in fish. The swamps along its eastern shores are overgrown with
pandan groves. The bay is covered during the rainy season with the
pink-flowered lotus plant. Along the low shores are veritable hunting
grounds which abound in snipe and wild ducks.

The province also abounds in picturesque sceneries, in the San Pablo
Valley there are nine beautifully-set crater lakes. Banahaw, a mountain
having an elevation of 7,382 feet, is covered with vegetation of all
kinds. In the crater of San Cristobal which has an elevation of about
5,000 feet there is a beautiful fresh water lake.

San Pablo is a progressive town well worth visiting. It is one of the
largest towns in the Islands and is up-to-date in every respect. A
large park overlooks a lake of rare beauty with the majestic San
Cristobal mountains in the background. A long flight of white stone
steps leads from the cliff above down to the lake shore, and the
park is a favorite picnic ground. The veteran's monument at this
point always attracts much attention. The town has numerous private
residences of striking architectural design.


[Pagsanjan Falls]

One of the prettiest and wildest spots lies within easy reach of
Manila--Pagsanjan Falls. Pagsanjan, the town, in itself worth seeing
for its beautiful residences and the surrounding forests, can be
reached in three and one-half hours by train or automobile through
a lovely coconut country. There are good hotel accommodations with
clean beds and food. Everything is done for the tourist; arrangements
are made for boats and guides, and launches are provided.

From the hotel you walk a short distance to a long row of bancas,
prow on shore, and a noisy throng of men clamoring for the favor of
your patronage; but you have probably chosen men at the hotel and are
conducted to certain boats by your guide. In the center of your boat
is the seat, a split bamboo chair with reclining back and bottom of
bamboo splints. The two boatmen take their places at the ends of the
boat and push off into the small stream for a few hundred yards to
Pagsanjan River.

The boat is paddled up the river past large rafts of coconuts, by
great trees dipping their leaves into the water. Along the shores are
parties of laughing people--some bathing and some washing clothes. Now
there are long reaches of quiet water, clear and deep; then banks
begin to rise above you; there is a swirl here, a ripple there, and
a swish below the gunwales. You are drawing toward the rapids. The
boatmen get put into the water and pull and tug and shove; the water
sucks viciously. The boat enters the gorge and its shadows. The river
becomes silent stretches of black water, and the air is cold. Above,
for hundreds of feet, tower the great cliffs of Pagsanjan to which
cling vines, desperate trees, and dripping shrubs. On all sides are
falls breaking upon the rocks and filling the canyon with a pleasant
murmur; then more rapids and sweeps of fierce water. Great boulders
have fallen into the river. Unable to paddle against the current or
to wade, the men now fight painfully forward by clinging to vines,
the rocks, anything. Then out of the boat again, lifting it and you
bodily up steps of pouring water, around corners, shooting across a
quiet pool into a fury of cascading foam. At times you scramble out
of the boat and detour a little over intervening rocks, while the
fight with the river goes on. For two hours the journey continues,
until you come to the end--a large pool--above you, Pagsanjan Falls,
the largest waterfall in the Islands, around, the insurmountable
cliffs fringed above by shining palms. Monkeys and iguanas scurry
over the slippery bluffs complaining at intrusion.

You should go prepared to rough it. Only a bathing suit is worn in
the boats and except at times of low water, kodaks had better be left
at the hotel, for rapids lap over the side. Indeed many have been the
spills in the swift water. But there is no danger, and a wetting is
of no consequence. The whole trip need cost no more than twenty pesos
nor occupy more than a day and a half.

It is a wonderful trip for those who enjoy the wilds. The gorge is
considered one of the beauty spots of the world.


RIZAL PROVINCE.--To the north of Laguna de Bay, is Rizal Province,
named after the national hero of the Filipinos. Pasig, the capital
is an important commercial town. It is located on the Pasig River,
a stream which is navigable thruout the year. Malabon, noted for her
fisheries and fish ponds, furnishes the City of Manila with choice fish
to the value of hundreds of thousands of pesos a year. A flourishing
poultry industry may be seen at Pateros. Parañaque is noted for its
embroideries while in Mariquina the chief industry is the making of
shoes and slippers. Along the borders of the Pasig River much grass is
cultivated to furnish the Manila market with green fodder for horses
and carabaos.

In this province are the towns of Pasig, San Juan del Monte,
and Caloocan where the first blood of the Philippine Revolution
against Spain was shed. Here also is to be found the historic spot
of Balintawak where Andres Bonifacio and his followers sounded the
well-remembered "Cry of Balintawak," the call for the outbreak of
the Revolution.


[Antipolo]

Antipolo has the shrine of Our Lady of Peace and Prosperous Voyages. It
is a town about half an hour's ride from Manila. It is built on a
mountainous section of the province of Rizal. The road is rather
steep and the scenery quite wild and impressive.

The image of the Virgin, commonly known as the "Virgin of Antipolo,"
was originally brought from Mexico by the Spaniards to insure the
safety of the galleons from the anger of the sea, and from the attacks
of the pirates who used to lie in wait in the San Bernardino Strait
and Verde Island Passage.


[Shrine]

The shrine is the most famous of all Philippine shrines. To
it thousands of devout Filipinos journey annually to pay their
respects. The Virgin is dressed in a robe that falls in a cone stiff
with gold and other jewels. It is estimated that the value of her
decoration is as high as P1,000,000.

The true history of the image is interesting, but still more remarkable
is the crust of legend with which the facts have become overlaid. It
was actually brought to the Islands in 1626 by Juan Niño de Tabora,
who had just been appointed Governor-General, and in 1672 it was
removed to its present home. According to the legends, the Virgin
crossed the Pacific eight or nine times, in addition to the original
voyage, and, on each one, calmed a tempest. On other occasions she
is said to have descended and appeared among the branches of the
antipolo or bread-fruit tree (whence the name of the present church),
to have survived the roaring fire in which the Chinese rebels cast
her in 1639, and to have given the Spaniards a complete victory over
twelve Dutch warships off Mariveles!




CAVITE PROVINCE.--This province is in the southwestern part of Luzon
lying along the shore of Manila Bay. It has a fine harbor in the city
of Cavite, actually the site of the United States Naval Station.

The most important agricultural products are rice, hemp, sugar, copra,
cacao, coffee, corn, and coconuts.

The city of Cavite, the capital, noted for its dock-yards is just
across the bay from Manila. It is an old town of historic interest. It
was there that the ships used in the Manila-Acapulco trade and in the
expeditions against the Mohammedan pirates in the south were fitted
out. In 1647 a Dutch squadron suddenly made its appearance off the
coast of the city and bombarded the fort. It is said that the Dutch
fired more than 2,000 cannon balls at the place, but in the end,
however, were forced to withdraw.

In 1872, a military mutiny led by Lamadrid took place in Cavite. This
mutiny though insignificant in itself had important political
results. The government made it an excuse for the execution of three
leading native priests, Dr. Jose Burgos and Fathers Gomez and Zamora,
and for the exile of many Filipino leaders of the liberal movement
of 1869-1871.


[Zapote Bridge]

From the beginning to the very end of the Revolution, Cavite Province
was the center of military operations. Zapote bridge, for example,
was more than once the scene of hard fighting. Practically every town
in the province was at one time or another fought over. Many of the
leaders of the Revolution, like Emilio Aguinaldo, who was President
of the Philippine Republic, his cousin Baldomero, Noriel, Trias,
and others are sons of Cavite. Moreover, when the Revolutionary
Government was established, Bacoor was really the first capital.


[Radio Station]

The city of Cavite is the United States' Navy base and radio station
in the Philippine Islands. The arsenal as well as the modern wireless
station in the extreme end of the peninsula should not be missed. The
city is about an hour's ride by automobile passing through the towns
of Parañaque, Las Piñas, Kawit, Noveleta, and San Roque. In the church
at Las Piñas may be seen the famous bamboo organ, old and quaint,
yet still serviceable. It was made by a priest exclusively from the
native bamboo tree. Cavite can also be reached by water, there being
small boats plying between the city and Manila at regular intervals.


[Kawit]

Kawit or Cavite Viejo is the town of General Emilio Aguinaldo. He
has his home there, which is noted for its historic interest. It is
preserved as it was during revolutionary days. Visitors can still see
the desk used by the General during the revolution as well as the holes
made by a cannon ball from Admiral Dewey's flagship "The Olimpia."




BATANGAS PROVINCE.--Batangas Province is immediately south of Cavite
Province. It has an irregular coastline and has many important ports,
such as Nasugbu, Calatagan, Balayan, Calaca, Lemeri, Taal, San Luis,
Batangas, Lobo, and San Juan.

At Laiya on the coast between San Juan and Lobo are the famous Lobo
submarine gardens. During fair weather the water here is as clear as
crystal and the submarine growth may be seen in all its varied colors.

The valleys and slopes of the province are extremely fertile because
of the disintegrated volcanic rock that is carried down from the
mountains by the river. Sugar, hemp, citrus fruits, coconut, corn,
mangoes, and other fruits and vegetables are grown in abundance. The
province is especially noted for its delicious oranges, grown in
Tanawan and Santo Tomas. Great herds of horses famous throughout the
archipelago as well as carabaos and cattle are raised on the mountain
slopes. Bawan and Lemeri are famous for the fine jusi and piña cloths
manufactured there and for the knotted abaca that is sent to Japan
for the manufacture of hats.


[Historical Incidents]

Throughout the 17th century the coast towns of Batangas suffered
greatly from Moro attacks. Stone forts were erected at various points
along the coast--in Lemeri, Taal, Bawan, and Batangas--but still
the Moros came. In 1754 as many as 38 Moro vessels appeared off the
coast. In 1763 the northern part of the province was visited by the
British in search of the treasure of the galleon "Philippine." The
expedition failed to find the treasure but went as far as Lipa
and plundered the town. Batangas was one of the first provinces to
start the revolution of 1896. Two of the great leaders of the period
were sons of the province, namely, the great lawyer and statesman,
Apolinario Mabini, and Miguel Malvar, the famous general.


[Attractions]

Among the attractions are the old picturesque buildings of Lipa
and Taal, the San Juan sulphur springs, the Bawan hot springs, and
the Rosario fresh water spring. There are also several caves and
grottos. The two largest are found in the slopes of Mount Pulan,
Suya, and Kamantigue of San Juan. One of the caves has an opening
of 40 meters in circumference. Issuing therefrom is an underground
river which empties into Lake Taal. Along its course are extensive
galleries and chambers lined with fantastically shaped stalactites
and stalagmites. At the approach of an eruption of the Taal Volcano
nearby, the cave emits a weird sound, audible at great distances.


[Taal Volcano]

Taal Volcano is the great scenic asset of the province. Almost at
the doors of Manila it is easily reached with practically none of the
discomfort which a trip to nature's wild spots usually involves. The
volcano is commonly known as the "cloud maker" and "the terrible." How
long this volcano has been emitting sulphurous smoke is not known; all
that is known is that back in the geologic past, volcanic outbursts
of enormous magnitude disturbed the regions about it. In the 18th
century the volcano erupted several times, and ruined many towns in
the neighborhood. The last and perhaps the worst eruption occurred
in January, 1911.

Then, after a long interval, old Taal, in a paroxysm of volcanic
activity, showed that he was still lusty and capable of making a huge
disturbance. In addition to the steam which had been coming from the
crater more or less continuously, the volcano began throwing out
mud. This activity increased, and culminated in a great explosion
at about half past 2 on the morning of January 30th. The hot water,
mud, and ashes completely devastated about 90 square miles of country;
while some mud and fine ashes fell over an area of more than 800 square
miles. Many villages were destroyed and the official estimate of the
dead was 1,335. The spasm of activity died away until the volcano
again assumed its normal state about February 8th. Since then it has
been very quiet, though a small mud geyser has started up along the
old fault line which extends from Taal to the coast. This is located
on the beach at the village of Sinisian.

Before the eruption the floor of the crater stood about five feet
above the level of Lake Bombon. In it were four prominent features:
Two small lakes of hot water, one green, the other more or less red;
near the center a gas vent five or six feet in diameter, from which the
hot gases roared as from a blast furnace; and just a little distance
away a triangular obelisk of hard volcanic rock. During the eruption
all of the material in the bottom of this crater, to a depth of about
230 feet, was heaved up and spread broadcast over the country. Later
on, this hole filled up with water, which seeped in from the lake
almost up to the level of the old floor, or about that of the lake
itself. There is now one large body of steaming water in place of
the former features, but the old obelisk still stands defiantly in
its place.

The volcano consists of an active crater near the center of a low
island not over 5 1/2 miles in its longest diameter. The island is
situated at the center of Taal Lake (Bombon) which is about 17 miles
long and 10 1/2 miles wide. The lake is 10 meters deep and is 2.5
meters above sea level.

A small launch carries those who would look down into the crater across
the lake to the island from which the volcano rises. The volcano is
about a thousand feet in height and is fairly easy to climb.




TAYABAS PROVINCE, the second largest, is on the Pacific coast of the
Philippine Islands. The province is noted for its copra, abacá and
corn which are raised for export. Mineral resources are abundant in
the Bondoc Peninsula where gold, coal, and petroleum are found. Aside
from agriculture and mining, however, there are other industries such
as hat-making and lumbering. There is a lumber camp at Guinayañgan
and a modern saw and planing mill in Lucena. The Botocan Falls,
where a stream 40 feet wide makes a leap of 190 feet, could supply
the entire province with light and power for all its needs.


[Lucena and Atimonan]

The spin to Lucena and Atimonan, both in the Province of Tayabas over
the South Road, is a favorite one. On the east are the little town of
Binañgonan de Lampon, a celebrated port in the sixteenth century in
the galleon trade, and the landlocked harbor of Hondagua, destined
to be the direct port of call of steamers coming from the Pacific
Coast of the United States and Canada.

On the way, stop can readily be made at the town of Calamba, Laguna,
about 37 miles from Manila. This is the birthplace of the Filipino
author, and patriot Dr. Jose Rizal. Although the house where he was
born is no longer standing, the site can easily be found opposite the
church and market. Calamba has an added importance in that the town has
a modern sugar central, which the traveler should not fail to visit.


[Los Baños]

A short detour can readily be made also at Los Baños ("The Baths"),
a town which owes its name and its importance to the hot mineral
springs which abound in the neighborhood and have been found to be of
great medicinal value especially for the treatment of certain skin
diseases and rheumatism. The springs have been known for a great
length of time. Even during the Spanish days the town was a much
frequented resort, a hospital with pools and vapored rooms having
been built as far back as 1571.


[College of Agriculture]

A short distance from Los Baños, and occupying an extremely picturesque
side are the palms and buildings of the College of Agriculture
of the University of the Philippines, an institution which trains
young Filipinos in a calling which must for many years to come be
the foundation of the economic prosperity of the islands.




THE BICOL PROVINCES.--Farther south, are the provinces of Albay,
Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, and Sorsogon, known as the Bicol
Provinces, because inhabited by Bicolanos. All four provinces are
noted for their beautiful mountain views and extensive plantations of
coconut and hemp. In Albay the forests are extensive, providing timber,
rattan, pili-nuts, and gum for export. Gutta-percha and Para rubber
trees are extensively cultivated. There are wide pasture grounds for
horses, cattle, carabaos, goats, and sheep. The temperature is even
and the nights are cool and refreshing. There are also salubrious
mineral springs, the best known being the Tiwi Hot Sulphur Springs
in the town of Naga.

The Province of Catanduanes abounds in gold, copper, and iron. The
Batan coal mines which are being operated are supplying several
manufacturing and gas plants. There are quarries of marble in Pantaon;
gypsum deposits in Ligao; and lime in Guinobatan and Camalig.

Camarines Norte is rich in mineral resources. Gold is found in many
places, exploitation being actually carried on in Paracale. There
are also deposits of iron, silver, lead, and copper.

Camarines Sur, on the valley of Bicol River and the Caramoan Peninsula,
is noted for its rattan industry. Hemp planting and fishing and
coconut growing are the other principal industries.

Sorsogon occupies the southernmost tip of the Bicol Peninsula. The
largest indenture in its irregular coast is the gulf of Sorsogon,
a land-locked body of water and one of the finest harbors in the
Philippines. The land is mountainous and covered with excellent lumber
suitable for ship-building and furniture making. In the forests rattan
grows in abundance and is exported to all the provinces. The chief
products are abaca and coconuts.

Sorsogon, the capital, located on the gulf, is an important commercial
town. Pilar is noted for her shipyards; ships, lorchas, and boats
are built here from the fine timber grown nearby.


[Sceneries]

Among the sceneries are the Guinulajon waterfalls, near the capital,
the wild vegetation and the cataracts along the Irosin River, the
medicinal hot springs of Mombon, Bujan, and Mapaso, together with
the beautiful panorama from the Bulusan Volcano are especially
striking. Like Mount Vesuvius, Mount Bulusan has an old crater,
and a new cone that has appeared on the slopes. Inside the crater,
about 500 feet deep, are two pools of hot water which form the basin
from which the Irosin River rises.

A great event in the history of Sorsogon was the invention of a
hemp-stripping machine by a priest named Espellargas, about 1669. The
invention was made in Bacon, where it seems hemp then abounded. The
contrivance was ingeniously constructed and was quite well adapted
to local conditions.


[Historical Incidents]

Many of the galleons that the Spanish Government used in the
Manila-Acapulco trade were built in Sorsogon, especially on the
Island of Bagatao, at the entrance of Sorsogon Bay. Many of these
ships were wrecked while navigating the waters of Sorsogon, because
they laid their course for Mexico via the San Bernardino Strait, a
passage which abounds in dangerous currents, shoals, and rocks. The
galleon San Cristobal was wrecked in 1733 near the Calantas Rock. In
1793, the galleon Magallanes also ran aground at this place. Other
vessels went down in this neighborhood from time to time, as the Santo
Cristo de Burgos, in 1726, near Ticao, and the San Andres, in 1798,
near Naranja Island.


[Volcanoes]

Peerless Mayon of the perfect cone is in Albay, the volcano of Isarog
in Ambos Camarines, and Bulusan in Sorsogon.

For those who love mountain climbing, the ascent to the peak of Mayon
Volcano should not be missed.

The actual ascent, though arduous, is perfectly practicable. It
requires from a day and a half to two days from Albay. By leaving the
latter place on horseback at noon it is possible to ride one-third
of the way up before dark. Leaving the horses at the camping place,
the summit can be reached and the return trip made to Albay on the
following day. A vivid description of the trip, written by Dr. Paul
C. Freer, Director of the Bureau of Science, follows:


   "This great volcano rises from the seacoast, between Legaspi and
    Tabaco, in the form of an almost perfect cone--the white houses and
    church towers of the surrounding settlements and the deeper-colored
    verdure of the trees at its base, higher up the brilliant green
    of the bare glass streaked here and there by old lava flows,
    and still higher a grayish black cinder and ash cone tapering
    to the peak, with a small plume of steam escaping apparently
    from the extreme summit. The ascent is interesting, but may, if
    proper precautions are not taken, be dangerous. The rise of the
    land in the first part is scarcely perceptible, the road winding
    through forest interspersed with great plantations of manila hemp;
    above, as it becomes steeper, the latter give way almost entirely
    to tropical jungle; and finally the path emerges into cogonal,
    which extends as far as the angle of the slope will permit. Here
    and there the entire slope is cut by deep ravines, indicating
    old lava flows. The way up the cone at first invariably lies in
    one of these ravines, but now and again the mountain climber is
    compelled to cross rolling cinder beds only a few inches deep,
    and lying upon a harder base, almost invariably with an abrupt
    descent below. The angle is so great that every precaution must be
    taken, as a slip would prove fatal. A good steelshod alpenstock
    is practically indispensable. The last five hundred feet are
    along the perpendicular lava and tuff crags of the summit, the
    ambitious climber clinging to the latter with hands and toes,
    wherever support is possible and slowly working his way to the
    edge of the crater. Finally, standing upon the rotten foothold
    afforded by the latter he looks down into what appears to be a
    deep dark well from which small quantities of sulphur-laden gas
    escape. Around him on the margin jets of steam arise; the ground
    on which he stands is hot, the boys carrying the canteens are far
    below, the dry breeze helps the evaporation, and he realizes that
    he is very, very thirsty. However, the view from the top repays
    all effort. The entire southern portion of Luzon is visible,
    stretching away in a succession of fields, forests, and diminutive
    villages, to the straits of San Bernardino, across which Samar
    may be seen, and even Leyte, on a clear day. The lake of Bato,
    the interisland waters, and finally Burias are seen to the west;
    to the north there appears apparently one unbroken stretch of
    land with here and there a glimpse of the sea; and the Gulf of
    Albay with the towns of Legaspi, Tabaco, and Daraga, as well
    as the smaller islands to the east, seem to be almost within a
    stone's throw. I have been high up on the slopes of Etna, at the
    entrance to the Val del Bobe, from which many travelers maintain
    the finest in the world is to be obtained, but I certainly think
    that from the summit of Mayon the vista surpasses the one from
    its sister volcano in Sicily.... Mayon Volcano is decidedly one
    of the show places of the Philippines, and the wonder is that many
    of our visitors do not take the opportunity to make the ascent."




BULACAN PROVINCE is named from the Tagalog word "bulac" meaning
"cotton" which was once the principal product of the region. Together
with the Provinces of Pampanga, Tarlac, and Nueva Ecija, the province
forms what is commonly known as the region of Central Luzon.


[Description and History]

The soil, which is of alluvial and volcanic origin, is rich. Rice,
corn, sugar, pineapples, bananas, betel nut, mangoes, and all sorts of
vegetables are raised in the well irrigated and low-lying lands. The
nipa swamps which supply most of the nipa thatches, vinegar, and
alcohol are the principal stand-by of a great many people. The forests
cover over 89,980 hectares and yield good commercial timber and many
minor forest products.

Aside from agriculture and mining, the industries of the province
are making hats (Baliuag) and silk textiles, weaving, tanning,
fish breeding, distilling alcohol, and furniture-making. Baliuag,
Meycauayan, Obando, Polo, Hagonoy, and San Miguel are the centers of
these industries.

In the events which followed the arrival of the British in 1762, the
province figured conspicuously, serving as a center of resistance
during British occupation of Manila. The Spanish Governor, Anda,
just before the capitulation of Manila escaped to this province where
he organized a government of his own to carry on hostilities against
the British and to hold the country in its loyalty to Spain. In the
encounters, however, between Anda's forces and the British, Anda's
resistance was overcome, and Bulacan like the other provinces fell
into British hands.

Some of the most notable events in the Philippine revolution took
place in Bulacan Province. It was at Biac-na-Bato, in the mountains of
Bulacan, where in December of 1897 the famous Pact of Biac-na-Bato was
concluded, and the town of Malolos was for some time the capital of
the Philippine Republic. Here, in the historic church of Barasoain,
the Congress which drafted the Constitution of the Republic held
its sessions. Conspicuous figures of the revolution like M. H. del
Pilar and Mariano Ponce whose names are connected with the period of
propaganda are sons of this province.


[Attractions]

Among the other attractions are the Mineral Baths at Marilao, on the
Manila north road, and Sibul Springs near San Miguel de Mayumo. This is
a popular health resort only about three hours ride from Manila. The
water of the springs have enjoyed a considerable reputation for a
long time. They are very beneficial in diseases of the intestinal
tract, especially those of a chronic and catarrhal nature. Owing to
the gases which the water contains the baths are most refreshing.




PAMPANGA PROVINCE is said to be the lowest and most level of all the
provinces. It is the chief sugar raising province in Luzon. Some of
the islands' modern sugar centrals are there. Besides farming, sugar
making, lumbering, and fishing, the people are engaged in several
other industries such as distillation of alcohol, buri hat making,
and pottery.


[Historical Incidents]

About the middle of the seventeenth century, two great rebellions
broke out in the province. The first of these took place in 1645 as a
result of the injustices connected with the collection of tributes. It
spread quickly and extended to Zambales. The second revolt took place
fifteen years later as a result of the forcible employment of natives
in the work of cutting timber and of the failure of the Government
to pay for large amounts of rice collected in Pampanga for the use
of the royal officials. The leader of the rebellion was Francisco
Maniago. It spread rapidly among the inhabitants of the towns along
the banks of the Pampanga River, and was only suppressed after drastic
measures were taken by Governor-General de Lara.

Pampanga was one of the first provinces to start the Revolution. During
the early part of the war Mariano Llanera commanded the Revolutionary
forces. Later Tiburcio Hilario took possession of the province as
governor in the name of the Revolutionary Government.


[Attractions]

Among the attractions are the sugar centrals, Camp Stotsenberg, one of
the principal Army posts and an airplane station of the United States,
dome-shaped Mount Arayat, about 3,300 feet in height and fairly easy
to climb, and San Fernando, the capital, with its handsome capitol
and school buildings grouped about the pretty plaza.

Arayat, a picturesque village lying at the foot of the mountain of that
name is an ideal spot for those desiring to camp out. Nearby is the
little barrio of Baño where there is an ancient tile bath constructed
by the Spanish Friars. It consists of a tile lined tank some forty
feet in length and of varying depths, filled by a crystal-clear spring
which gushes into it from a grassy bank just above.

Mount Arayat is a perfect cone that rises majestically from the
immense plain of Central Luzon, and is visible for miles around,
presenting the same conical shape no matter from what direction viewed.

Several trails lead to the top of the mountain from where a wonderful
panorama can be seen. It was an insurgent stronghold during the war,
but its heights were scaled by American troops and its defenders
dispersed. Scientists state that the mountain is an extinct volcano and
local tradition has it that the original town of Arayat was destroyed
by an eruption and covered by ashes.




TARLAC PROVINCE is also in the central plain of Luzon. The province
has two distinct geographical areas. The northern and eastern parts
consists of an extensive plain while the rest is covered with mountains
which abound in timber suitable for building material and furniture
making. The minor forest products are anahaw, palasan, rattan, honey
and bojo for sawali.

There was an uprising in this province somewhere in 1762 headed by
Juan de la Cruz Palaris. In 1896 the province was one of the original
eight provinces where a state of war was declared to be in existence
against the Spaniards. When Malolos was evacuated by the Philippine
Revolutionary Government, the town of Tarlac became for a time the
central headquarters.

Among the attractions are the medicinal springs in O'Donell in the
municipality of Capas and those of Sinait.




NUEVA ECIJA PROVINCE is the rice granary of the Philippine Islands,
being first in the production of the cereal, Pangasinan coming
second. The rolling hills towards the mountains are suitable for
pasture lands. The mountains are thick with untouched forests that
yield fine wood and other minor products. In the mountains and rivers
gold is found. The province was one of the first eight provinces to
raise the standard of revolt in 1896. It has a number of flourishing
towns at present, due to the continuous boom in the rice market. There
are many mineral hot springs, the ones at Bongabon and Pantabañgan
being the most important. Among the attractions are the irrigation
system in San Jose which supplies water over an extensive territory
and the Government Agricultural School at Muñoz which is attended
by many students from all the provinces, and which is noted for its
unique method of practical instruction.




[Attractions]

BATAAN PROVINCE occupies the whole of the peninsula lying between
the China Sea and Manila Bay. It is a province of various peculiar
phenomena. Northwest of Dinalupihan is a small conical mountain,
250 meters high, which has a fresh water lake at the top. In the
neighborhood of Malasimbo are a few shallow marshes, the shores and
waters of which are tinted red by dust said to be formed from the
remains of microscopic animalculæ. Near Orani is a bed of iron hydride
which the people of the region used to make into paints for walls
and carriages. There are also deposits of clay of which "pilones"
are made. There is also a large deposit of shells which are burned
for lime used in the indigo and sugar industries. On the shores of
Orani is a fresh water spring that rises from a spot covered daily
by the tides. Near the town of Orion is a quaking bog, impassable by
either man or beast. Another, smaller one, is found in Ogon, Balanga.


[Historical Incidents]

During the first two decades of the seventeenth century, the coast of
Bataan was more than once the scene of battles against the Dutch. The
first of these encounters took place in 1600 off the coast of
Mariveles. The Dutch were commanded by Admiral Van Noort, while the
Spanish-Filipino army was led by the historian, Antonio de Morga,
then an order of the Manila Real Audiencia. The Spanish-Filipino
squadron suffered heavy losses, but the Dutch were nevertheless
forced to retreat. Nine years later, the Dutch again appeared off
the Mariveles coast. This time they were led by Admiral Wittert,
against whom Governor Silva sent a hastily fitted out squadron
of six small vessels manned by Spaniards and Filipinos. The Dutch
were defeated. In spite of these reverses, the Dutch continued their
hostile visits to the Philippines. In 1646, they bombarded Zamboanga,
unsuccessfully attacked Cavite, and finally effected a landing in
Abucay, Bataan. Here they committed depredations and massacred more
than four hundred Filipino soldiers who had laid down their arms. They
were not driven away until after a long siege.


[Mariveles]

The town of Mariveles and Mount Mariveles are the principal
attractions. The town has an important harbor where the ships are
detained and fumigated when necessary before entering or leaving
Manila Bay. West of the town is a quarry of white stone called by the
Spaniards, "mármol de Mariveles." This stone has served as material
for the pedestal and column of the statue of Charles IV in Manila. A
well near the quarry produces siliceous water.

There is a beautiful legend connected with the town of Mariveles. A
Spanish girl by the name of Maria Velez, who was a nun in Santa Clara
Convent, fell in love with a friar, with whom she later eloped to
Kamaya, there to await a galleon on which they intended to secure
passage for Acapulco. The elopement caused excitement in Manila,
and the corregidor (magistrate) with a few men was sent to Kamaya
in search of the refugees. It is said that in memory of the persons
involved in this story Kamaya was given the name of Mariveles, the
big island to the south was named Corregidor, the little island to
the west was called Monja (nun) and another small island, off the
Cavite coast, was called Fraile.


[Mount Mariveles]

Mount Mariveles rises in the midst of the whole peninsula of Bataan. It
is about 4,700 feet in height and forms a conspicuous object from
the city especially when illuminated by the brilliant hues of the
sunset sky. Though once an active volcano its sides are now covered
with vegetation and practically the whole of its slopes down to a
very short distance off the shore are virgin tropical jungles. The
ascent of the mountain can be conveniently made from a day and a half
to two days from Lamao, where the Philippine Government maintains a
scientific experimental farm. The trail up the mountain passes along
a ridge with here and there steep but short slopes. As the ascent is
made the trees become noticeably smaller and orchids, ferns, mosses
and the like much more abundant. From the first peak 2,800 feet high,
the traveler can obtain a view of what Agassiz termed the greatest
wonders of nature--the sea, the mountains, and the tropical forests.

The view from the very top surpasses that from the first peak. To
the east lies the bay, with Manila and Cavite in the distance; to
the south nestles Corregidor Island with the surf beating its shores;
beyond is the China Sea, dotted here and there with specks of vessels
bound to and from Hongkong or the other islands; to the north and
west is a semi-circle of forest-covered peaks, standing as sentinels
guarding the amphitheater-like crater; and to the northeast lie the
cultivated fields of rice and sugar cane, studded here and there with
the church steeples that mark the sites of the towns.




ZAMBALES PROVINCE.--North of Bataan along the western coast of Luzon
is the Province of Zambales. It has two important harbors that are
well sheltered--Olongapo and Subic. Olongapo is a naval station which
boasts of one of the largest floating dry docks in the world.

Zambales was also visited by the Dutch during the early part of
the seventeenth century. It was in 1617 that Admiral Spielbergen,
with a powerful fleet appeared off the coast of Playa Honda. The
Government forces, under the command of Juan Ronquillo, sallied out
and engaged the Dutch squadron. Spielbergen displayed much bravery,
but was defeated.


[Naval Station]

The only points of particular interest are the Naval Station along the
coast which is, however, practically abandoned, and the fortifications
on Grande Island, at the entrance to the bay. To visit either of them
permits from the military or naval authorities are necessary. The
floating dry-dock Dewey whose voyage from the United States was a
matter of much public interest in 1906 is now located here.




PANGASINAN PROVINCE is the second largest rice producing province in
the archipelago. Tobacco and coconuts are also principal products. The
swamp lands and the tide flats are sources of nipa thatches and
alcohol. Mongo, cogon, sugar cane, and mangoes are also raised
extensively.


[Salt Making and Industries]

Along the tidal flats, salt making is so universal that the province
has been named "Pangasinan," meaning, "the place where there is
salt." Large parts of these same tidal lands are converted into
artificial fish ponds with suitable gates that admit water during
high tide. Even as far south as Bayambang, the overflowed lands of the
Agno River have been converted into similar ponds where quantities of
fresh-water fish are obtained and shipped to Manila in large baskets
containing water.

The famous Calasiao hat made from the leaf of the buri palm comes from
Pangasinan. Mat-making is an industry in Bani and Bolinao. Lingayen
uses the palm fiber for making sugar sacks and San Carlos for the
"salacot" or native helmet. Calasiao, Mañgaldan, and San Carlos prepare
the "tabo" or native cup from the coconut shell. Binmaley and Dagupan
manufacture the "sueco" (wooden shoe), from the woods cut in the
Zambales mountains. San Carlos, Binmaley, Santa Barbara, Malasiqui,
and Bayambang have brickyards and manufactories of pottery. Mañgaldan
is famous for its indigo blue and blue-black dyes.


[Historical Events]

Historically the province is important in that it was there that in
1574 the Chinese pirate Limahong after his repulse in Manila appeared
with his vast army at the mouth of the Agno River and tried to found
a settlement on its banks. This attempt, however, was a failure.

During the period from 1660 to about 1765, two important revolts
occurred in Pangasinan. The first was in 1660 led by Andres Malong,
who attempted to establish a great kingdom with Binalatoñgan as
capital and comprising all of northern and western Luzon as far
south as Zambales and Pampanga. The second revolt was led by the
famous Pangasinan leader, Juan de la Cruz Palaris, often known as
"Palaripar." It took place in 1762, caused by the injustices of the
tribute. Its center was also at Binalatoñgan. It lasted over two years,
ending with the capture and execution of Palaris in 1765.




MOUNTAIN PROVINCE.--The Mountain Province is the third largest province
in the Philippines. It comprises the vast mountainous territory between
the Provinces of Cagayan, Isabela, Nueva Vizcaya, and the Ilocos. It
is made up of several sub-provinces.

Bakun district in the sub-province of Amburayan has some of the
most striking rice terraces thousands of feet high. It is a region
surrounded by high precipices, so that parts of the trails to Bakun
consist of ladders hundreds of feet high on the sides of the cliffs.

The sub-province of Apayao contains one of the richest virgin forests
in the Philippines but because of the difficulty of transportation
lumber is not cut on a commercial scale. There are also deposits of
copper and ore as well as limestone but they are little explored.

The sub-province of Benguet is at present the most important
gold-mining district in the Mountain Province. The Igorots had
exploited the mines long before the coming of the Spaniards and it is
said that because of the experience already acquired, the Igorots are
today more skillful gold miners than those who use their knowledge of
chemistry and mining engineering. Hot springs are found at Klondikes,
Daklan, and Bungias. Coal deposits exist in Mount Kapangan.

The city of Baguio, the capital of Benguet, is situated in the
southwestern part of the province. About 160 miles to the north of
Manila, it is built high up among the Benguet mountains. It ranges in
elevation from 4,500 to over 5,500 feet, and is surrounded practically
on all sides by high mountains. The city at present is the summer
capital of the Philippines. For a fuller description see page 61.

The sub-province of Bontok is exceedingly mountainous. Besides
agriculture and pottery making, the principal industries consist of
basket making, lumbering, weaving, and metal working. The women by
means of their hand-looms weave a great deal of high colored cloth
out of yarn which they get by barter from the people of Isabela and
Abra. The men manufacture head-axes and knives.


[Ifugao Rice Terraces]

The sub-province of Ifugao is famous for the remarkable rice terraces
along its mountain sides. Nowhere in the Philippines is irrigation
developed to the point reached in this sub-province. There are
approximately 100 square miles of irrigated rice terraces that are
watered by great ditches several miles long. The terraces are all
buttressed with stone walls which measure a total length of about
12,000 miles. These terraces have been built without any knowledge
of engineering. It is believed that the construction of the present
terraces and irrigation systems has taken from 1,200 to 1,500 years of
time. Generation after generation had toiled on them patiently. The
Ifugaos have so utilized every drop of available water supply that
in most places no more ditches can be constructed for lack of water.

The terraces are built of stones mined near by, of which there are
extensive areas. No animals are used for field work everything being
done by hand. Salt springs and deposits of rock salts are also found
in several places.

The sub-province of Lepanto is next to Ifugao in the number of
rice terraces. Camotes, pineapples, sugar cane, and cotton are also
raised. Lepanto and Benguet are the regions having the most minerals
in Luzon. All the mountain ranges have millions of pesos worth of
copper ore deposits. Mankayan is the center of the copper mining
industry. Here the Spaniards found the natives using the Chinese
method of mine smelting.


[Gold Mining and Industries]

Suyok is the gold mining center. Here is found one of the most striking
features of the world. The whole side of a range of mountains, about
15 kilometers across, slides down to the valley, and on this slide,
named the Palidan Slide, are found parts of gold veins which must
have their connection somewhere else.

The household industries are well developed. Clay products, such
as pots, jars, and pipes are made for export. The men are experts
in metal-working. They make weapons, pots, and spoons out of copper
which they mine and smelt by native process. They also manufacture
iron or steel spears, bolos, knives, and tools of all sorts, which
they sell to or barter with the natives of the lowlands. They also
carve wood into images, bowls, ornaments, and other utensils.

The women make sufficient cloths for their own use and for sale. They
spin, dye, and weave the cotton raised there.




LA UNION PROVINCE occupies a narrow strip of land immediately north of
the Province of Pangasinan and west of the Mountain Province. Tobacco,
rice, sisal, hemp, sugar, coconuts, corn, and cotton form the most
important products. At the foot of Mount Bayabas is a hot salt
spring. The Manila Railroad operates lines as far as Bauang. San
Fernando, the capital, may be reached either by boat or by automobile
from Bauang.


[Industries]

ILOCOS SUR PROVINCE.--Immediately north of La Union is the Province of
Ilocos Sur, a region specially adapted to the cultivation of maguey
the fiber of which constitutes the principal export. But because
the soil will not support the population a great many persons have
turned to manufacture and trade. This has given rise to industrial
specialization in different towns. Those along the coast extract
salt from the sea water and export it in great quantities to inland
provinces. In San Esteban, there is a quarry of stone from which
mortars and grindstones are made. San Vicente, Vigan, and San Ildefonso
specialize in woodworking, the first in carved wooden boxes and images
and the others in household furniture. Most of the wood used in these
handicrafts is imported from Abra and Cagayan. Bantay is the home of
skilled silversmiths. In the other towns saddles, harness, slippers,
mats, pottery, and hats are made and exported to some extent. Sisal
and hemp fiber extraction and weaving of cotton cloth are common
household industries throughout the province.

The province embraces within its confines some of the oldest towns in
the Philippines. Besides Vigan several other towns already existed
in this region before the close of the sixteenth century; namely,
Santa, Narvacan, Bantay, Candon, and Sinait.

Just above Narvacan, on the highway which runs along the beach is an
ancient watch-tower and a stretch of road bordered by a curious brick
retaining wall of Spanish construction. Numerous ancient shrines are
also to be seen along the Ilocos roads where the pious prayed that
Heavenly favor might be shown them in their journeys.

The towns of Paoay and Batac are noted for their magnificent churches
which are worth traveling a long distance to see.


[Historical]

Two important uprisings are recorded in the history of Ilocos Sur--the
Malong rebellion in 1660 and the Silang rebellion in 1763. Malong,
who was trying to carve out a kingdom for himself in Pangasinan
and the neighboring territory, sent his two able generals, "Count"
Gumapos and Jacinto Macasiag to the north to effect the conquest of
this region. Gumapos and Macasiag, however, proceeded only as far as
Vigan, from which place they were recalled by Malong. Diego Silang,
who led the great rebellion of 1762, dominated the greater part of
Ilocos Sur. He fought pitched battles with the Spanish forces at Vigan
and Cabugao and practically succeeded in establishing a government
of his own in Ilocos Sur.




ILOCOS NORTE PROVINCE occupies the whole of the coastal plain in the
northwestern corner of Luzon. This province is noted for the many
revolts that occurred there, from the beginning of Spanish rule to the
first decades of the nineteenth century. The two most important were
those caused by the general discontent over the tobacco monopoly and
over the wine monopoly, which occurred in 1788 and 1807 respectively.

The mountains surrounding the province are covered with fine timber
trees. Resin, honey, and wax are also found on their slopes. A few
grottos or caves are found in the interior. There are a number of
stone quarries. Limestone is found in at least three places, while
the beach supplies a great amount of coral for road building. There
are also deposits of manganese and asbestos which are being exploited.

The weaving of textiles--towels, blankets, wearing apparel, and
handkerchiefs--is the principal industry among women. Mat-making and
the pottery industry are also well developed.

Laoag, the capital, has a population of about 40,000. It is entered
from the south by crossing the longest bridge in the islands. Laoag
plaza, on which the provincial buildings front, is well cared for
and the ancient bell tower on the opposite side is said to resemble
a famous Italian campanile.

Bangui is "farthest north" in Luzon where the highway ends. Its climate
is cool resembling that of a California summer. Woolen clothes may
be worn with comfort in the cold season. It is always swept by cool
breezes. The view of sea and land from the crest of a hill just
before Bangui is entered will hold the attention of even the most
travelled tourist.




ABRA PROVINCE is south of Ilocos Norte. It is a beautiful mountainous
region. It is considered to be the seismic center of Northern Luzon. It
is drained by the voluminous Abra River which is the highway to the
Province of Ilocos Sur. The valley drained by this river and its
tributaries is covered with luxuriant vegetation. Corn, tobacco, and
rice are the most important products. The mountains are covered with
forests containing timber eminently suitable for construction. There
is gold dust along the Binoñgan River in the town of Lacub. Of mineral
springs that of the Iomin River is the most important. This has a
temperature ranging from 70 degrees to 80 degrees Fahrenheit with a
flow of 3 to 4 cubic centimeters per second.


[Cagayan River]

THE CAGAYAN VALLEY.--Adjoining the Mountain Province in the very
northeastern corner of Luzon is the Province of Cagayan. Together with
the neighboring Provinces of Isabela and Nueva Vizcaya to the south it
forms what is known as the Cagayan Valley. Something of these great
tobacco provinces can be seen by taking the steamer from Manila to
Aparri and then sailing up the Cagayan River. This is a Mississippi,
a Nile of a river, navigable by interisland steamers for twenty-five
miles. Its chief importance lies in its periodical inundations,
which, leaving their deposits of alluvial loam along the strips
of lowland by the banks of the stream, make it the finest tobacco
country of this part of the world. This crop has for a very long
time been the staple source of wealth, though other plants can be
cultivated with success. How great is the productivity of the soil,
despite the exhausting effect of tobacco upon it, may be gathered from
the following remark made in an official report. "The 'good land' was
understood to be those parts fertilized annually by the overflow of
the river.... The other land was not considered first class because it
could only produce tobacco for ten or twelve years without enrichment,
the subject of fertilizing never having received any attention from
the planters of that region."

By small boats it is possible to reach Cauayan, Isabela. From there
the road is so nearly completed that autos can be taken to Santa Fé,
Nueva Vizcaya, where it divides, one branch, an automobile road,
leading to San Jose, Nueva Ecija, and thence to Manila; the other a
horseback trail to San Nicolas, Pangasinan, a short and easy stage
to the railroad. Among the sights is a salt-incrusted mountain,
a dazzling landmark for miles around in Nueva Vizcaya. The people
thereabouts often place small objects, such as baskets, under the
drip of the salt springs. These become coated with salt in such a
manner that they appear to be of pure marble.


[Isabela and Palanan]

Like many other provinces Isabela Province was the scene of important
uprisings. In 1763, for example, stirred by the influence of the
Silang rebellion in Ilocos, the people of Isabela revolted, led
on by Dabo and Juan Morayac. The centers of rebellion were Ilagan
and Cabagan. Again in 1785, another revolt broke out. This time the
rebellion was led by Labutao and Baladon. The rebellion was caused
by the grievances of the people against the collection of tribute
and the enforcement of the tobacco monopoly.

The historical spot of Isabela is the little town of Palanan on
Palanan Bay, on the Pacific Coast. The bay is exposed to the weather
and the anchorage is reefy, while the town is separated from the
rest of the province by great mountains which make communication
and travel difficult and dangerous. It was in this town that General
Emilio Aguinaldo retreated and maintained his headquarters until his
capture by General Funston by a ruse in March, 1901.




[Salinas Salt Springs]

NUEVA VIZCAYA PROVINCE is south of Cagayan on the Pacific Coast
of Luzon. It contains vast areas of fertile public lands suitable
for rice, tobacco, sugar, coconuts, beans, potatoes, coffee, and
abaca, practically untouched, as well as virgin forests filled
with all classes of valuable timber. The province is the gateway
to and granary of the tobacco-producing provinces to the north. The
climatic conditions of the province are unsurpassed. There are places
the climate of which is similar to that of Baguio. There are also
places of scenic beauty, such as Salinas, which are not inferior
to world-famous objectives of tourist travel. The salt springs at
Salinas have been from time immemorial the source of this essential
food element to the peoples of even distant regions.




MINDORO PROVINCE is named after the Spanish phrase "mina de oro" or
"gold mine," as mining is said to have once been a great source of
wealth in the region. The province is co-extensive in territory with
the Island of Mindoro, southwest of Luzon. Rice, copra, abacá, sugar,
and corn are the principal products. Along the coast are extensive
nipa swamps.


[Mineral Deposits]

Gold is found in the Rivers of Binabay, Baco, Bongabong, and Magasauan
Tubig. Coal of good quality is found north and west of Bulalacao,
white marbles northwest of Mount Halcon, slate deposits near the
headquarters of Pagaban and other rivers of the western coast, sulphur,
and gypsum on Lake Naujan, and south of Calapan, hot springs between
the sea and the northwestern part of Lake Naujan, and salt springs
in Damagan, Bulalacao. Guano deposits are found in the caves.


[Submarine Garden]

An interesting two-day trip from Manila is that to the landlocked
harbor of Puerto Galera at the northern end of the island. The
attraction of the place lies in the fine scenery along the coast and
in the unusual transparency of the water, which permits visitors,
especially if glass-bottomed boats are at hand, to inspect the varied
life which teems in the depths below. There is here as on the coast of
Batangas a marine garden of bewildering and exquisite beauty. Nature
seems to have made special effort to crowd beneath a few acres of
sea all of the most entrancing wonders of the deep. There is coral of
every design, color, and variety. There are thousands of plants which
present a wealthy and gorgeous harmony of color. There are myriads of
wonderful fish which outrival the coral and the vegetation in variety
and richness of hue. Some are as green as grass, others as gold as
a guinea.

There are at present no regular boats making the trip and special
arrangements will have to be made in order to be able to visit
the place.




PALAWAN.--The province of Palawan occupies the long and narrow Island
of Palawan situated between Mindoro on the north and Borneo on the
south. Besides this long and narrow island the province includes about
200 other small islets. A great part of the island is still unexplored,
the island itself not being accessible to the traveler. The chief
industries of the people are fishing, gathering trepangs, sea-shells,
and edible birds' nest on the limestone cliffs near the shore.

The proximity of the island with the Dutch East Indies and to Borneo
puts it in a very advantageous position commercially. It is also
favored by valleys of great fertility and by well protected harbors.


[Iwahig Penal Colony]

Among the places of special interest in Palawan may be mentioned
Balabac on the island of the same name. It was to this island that many
of the Filipinos were exiled in 1896 because of alleged complicity
in the Katipunan which in August of that year raised the standard of
revolt. The Iwahig Penal Colony about 8 miles from Puerto Princesa,
the capital, is also easy of access. This is a novel experiment
in the reformatory treatment of criminals. Here have been gathered
under the name of "colonists" over 500 convicts who have conducted
themselves well at Bilibid prison in Manila. They are put at entire
liberty without any armed guard or any special restraint. All of the
petty officers are prisoners as are also all the police. Agriculture
and various trades are carried on, and, under certain conditions,
the prisoners are given an allotment of land and their families are
allowed to join them.


[Culion Leper Colony]

To the north of the province is the little Island of Culion where
the leper colony is situated. There is no regular transportation
except by the government cutter that makes periodical trips, and
the colony itself is not ordinarily open to visitors. There are
about 2,000 inmates in the colony and they are well taken care of by
the Philippine Government, many having been cured completely of the
unfortunate malady. In minor matters the lepers form a self-governing
community electing their own council and supplying the policemen and
other subordinate officials.


[Underground River]

On the west coast of Palawan, almost uninhabited and still largely
uncharted, there is a very remarkable underground river. This has
been explored several times by Government officials, a launch having
in one instance entered the mouth and proceeded under the mountain
for more than 2 miles. At present the river can only be reached by
taking a long and expensive trip away from the main routes of travel,
but it is destined some time to be known as one of the remarkable
sights of the world.




ROMBLON PROVINCE.--The Province of Romblon has nothing of special
interest to the tourist except the town of Romblon which has one of the
best natural harbors in the islands and the extensive marble deposits
which have been quarried and used for years and are now disappearing.




THE VISAYAS.--The "Visayas" is the general name given to the central
portion of the Philippine Archipelago. It includes the large Islands of
Panay, Negros, Cebu, Bohol, Leyte, and Samar, and a very great number
of smaller islands and islets. Though greatly broken up by mountains,
these contain the most thickly populated districts in the Islands
and constitute by far the largest area inhabited by a single stock
(the Visayan) and speaking, though with many dialect variations, one
language. Within this area are the best sugar and some of the best
hemp lands, and many other important products of the Islands grow
well. To the tourist, perhaps, they do not, outside of the cities of
Cebu and Iloilo, abound in "sights." But the larger islands exhibit
many fine vistas; and the smaller ones, mostly mountainous, form with
the surrounding tropical waters a combination which, for color and
variety of outline, rivals the Inland Sea of Japan at its best.




SAMAR PROVINCE comprises the whole Island of Samar which is the
fourth largest island in the Archipelago. It lies southeast of
Luzon and is separated from the Province of Sorsogon by the San
Bernardino Strait. The island is very rugged and nearly all of the
towns are located near the coast. Another characteristic feature
of the mountain regions is the presence of caves of which the most
noted is the Sohotan cave near Basey. River transportation is the
chief means of communication.


[Where the Spaniards first landed]

To Samar belongs the distinction of being the first island of the
Philippine Archipelago to be discovered by the Spaniards. On March 16,
1521, Ferdinand Magellan sighted the island, and the day following,
landed on the little island of Homonhon. In 1649 the greatest part
of the Island of Samar became involved in a great rebellion which
became the signal of general uprising in the Visayan Islands and in
parts of Mindanao. The cause of the uprising was enforced labor in
connection with shipbuilding. It lasted about a year. The rebels
fortified themselves in the mountains and there established an
independent settlement. From here they sallied forth from time to
time and harassed the Spanish forces sent against them.




ILOILO AND CAPIZ.--The Provinces of Iloilo and Capiz occupy the
entire eastern portion of the Island of Panay, immediately south of
Romblon Island. They consist of an extensive plain extending far back
to the foot of a range of mountains that traverses the western part
of the island.

The Panay line of the Philippine Railway Company cuts directly through
this plain extending as far as Capiz, the capital of the province of
the same name, immediately north of Iloilo Province.


[Attractions]

The trip over the railroad takes the traveler past several points
of interest. Just beyond Ventura there are seen to the west of the
tract a series of high mountain cliffs of white coral rock. These
are honeycombed by caves of wonderful structure and great beauty. One
of the most beautiful resembles an immense stage, set with elaborate
scenery. Another of great extent and variety is entered by descending
through a shaft resembling a well. An hour's walk from the entrance
leads the traveler to a place where the roof has collapsed and trees
have grown to gigantic heights, the cave continuing to an unknown
distance.

The natural bridge of Suhut in the town of Dumalag, Capiz, is also
worth visiting. Near the natural bridge is a spring of sulphurous
and salty water.

The City of Iloilo is described elsewhere, page 64.




[Haciendas and Sugar Centrals]

THE ISLAND OF NEGROS.--This island is divided into two
provinces--Occidental Negros and Oriental Negros. Occidental Negros
is about three hours' ride by boat from the City of Iloilo. It is the
most important sugar producing district in the Philippines. About 75
per cent of all the exported sugar comes from this province. Bacolod,
Bago, Talisay, San Carlos, Binalbagan, and La Carlota are the centers
of the sugar industry. There are about 518 haciendas and about half
a dozen sugar centrals in actual operation. The sugar centrals are
well worth the visit and the traveler should not miss them. Other
principal places of interest are Mount Canlaon, an active volcano and
the Mambucal Hot Springs, which is recommended by medical authorities.

The trip to Oriental Negros has to be made direct from Manila, although
there are boats from Cebu and Iloilo calling occasionally at Dumaguete,
the capital.


[Silliman Institute]

The principal points of interest in Dumaguete are the old watch-tower
on the plaza, built to guard against surprise by piratical Moro
fleets, and the buildings of the Silliman Institute. This latter is
a high-grade Protestant endowed school, with preparatory, classical,
and industrial departments; in it are enrolled some 500 students,
representing a wide range of localities. It was founded in 1901 with
a gift of Dr. Horace B. Silliman, of New York, and is now maintained
by the Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions. The buildings are
located on the beach, about five minutes' walk from the central part
of the town.


[Other Places of Interest]

There are a few other places of some interest within a moderate
distance of Dumaguete. Among these are some hot springs, about 6
kilometers (about 4 miles) west of the town. There is a fairly good
horse trail to within a few minutes' walk of them, and the scenery
along the route is picturesque. Of more interest is the active Volcano
of Magaso, which lies 14 kilometers to the south. It is accessible by
a good trail; and a horse can be ridden to the top of the crater. The
descent into the latter is not difficult.




CEBU PROVINCE.--The Island of Cebu which is co-extensive with
the province of that name was discovered by Magellan on April 7,
1521. The town was then under the rule of Raja Humabon, a powerful
chief who had eight subordinate chieftains and a force of some two
thousand warriors under him. Magellan made friends with Humabon and
succeeded in baptizing him, his wife, and as many as eight hundred
of his men. Magellan also endeavored to bring the people of Mactan
under Spanish influence. In this attempt, he was killed while engaged
in battle with the people of Opon who were then under Chief Lapulapu.


[First Spanish Settlement]

Forty-four years after Magellan's time, Legaspi occupied the town
of Cebu which was then under the rule of Tupas. Here Legaspi founded
the first Spanish settlement in the Philippines which he called San
Miguel. The town, which was planned in the shape of a triangle, was
defended on the land side by a palisade and on the two sides facing
the sea by artillery. The name of the town was later changed to the
City of the Most Holy Name of Jesus "in honor of an image of the
Child Jesus which a soldier had found in one of the houses."

The establishment of the Spanish settlement in Cebu brought to
this island the Portuguese who then disputed the ownership of the
Archipelago. In 1566, 1568, and 1570, Portuguese expeditionary forces
were sent to Cebu to drive away the Spaniards. First in 1568 and
again in 1570, the Portuguese blockaded Cebu, but in both cases the
blockade resulted in a failure.

The plains yield as many as three crops of corn a year. Coconuts,
sugar cane, abaca, peanuts, bananas, pineapples, camotes, and tobacco
are other products.


[Industries]

The island is rich in minerals, of which gold and coal are the most
important. Industries are well developed in Cebu. Good fishing banks
found along the coast furnish the people with food for local use and
for export. Hogs and goats are raised for local use. Poultry raising
enables the people to export chickens and eggs to neighboring islands
and even to Manila. Cotton cloth, woven for local use and sinamay
made from the fiber extracted from banana and pineapple leaves,
are exported. Much tuba, a native wine, is collected in the coconut
regions.

The town of Cebu, however, existed as a prosperous native settlement
before the discovery of the Philippines by Magellan. For a description
of the places of interest in the city, see page 63.




BOHOL PROVINCE, the island southeast of Cebu, is noted for the two
big rebellions against the Spaniards which occurred in 1622 and 1744,
respectively. The leader of the revolt in 1622, which was really an
armed protest against Jesuitical influence, was one by the name of
Tamblot. The uprising rapidly spread throughout the entire island;
only the towns of Loboc and Baclayon remained peaceful. The rebels
retreated "to the summit of a rugged and lofty hill, difficult of
access," and there fortified themselves. It took the government six
months to suppress this rebellion.


[Rebellions]

Another rebellion, no less formidable than the Tamblot uprising,
broke out in 1744. It gained strength in 1750 under the leadership of
Dagohoy, who for a long time was the whole soul of the movement. The
rebellion affected almost the entire island and lasted for over eighty
years. The government sent several expeditions to put it down, but
without success. The rebels established a local government and lived
as an independent people. This was, perhaps, the most successful
revolt the Filipinos ever conducted from the viewpoint of duration
of resistance.


[Attractions]

Among the attractions are the mineral springs in Guindulman as well
as those in San Juan, Candon, Napo, Lubod, and Cambalaguin which are
reputed to be efficacious for curing skin diseases. Edible birds'
nests are gathered in the Cananoan Cave. Other caves are found in
Baclayon, Guindulman, Jagna, and Sierra Bullones. "Buri," "ticog," and
"salacot" hats are made in almost every town. The weaving of "piña" and
"sinamay" cloth is a specialty in Baclayon, Loboc, Jagna, and Duero,
and "saguaran" weaving in Talibon, Inabanga, Baclayon, and Jetafe. The
commercial exploitation of the pearl and shell banks in the Bohol
seas has only recently been begun. The catching of the flying lemur
and the tanning and preparation of its hide is a new occupation. Most
of the towns are found along the coast so that a great portion of
the inhabitants are engaged in coastwise and interisland trade.




LEYTE PROVINCE and island, one of the largest and most fertile
regions in the Visayan group, is situated southwest of Samar and
is separated from Samar by the San Juanico Strait, said to be one
of the most beautiful water-ways in the world. Hemp and copra are
the most important products exported. Coal is found in the towns of
Leyte, Ormoc, and Jaro. Asphalt is being mined in Leyte for street
paving purposes. Gold is found in Pintuyan and San Isidro; sulphur
in Mahagnao; mineral springs in the crater of Mahagnao, Ormoc, San
Isidro, Mainit, and Carigara.


[Where Mass First Celebrated]

Limasawa, a little island south of Leyte, has the unique
distinction of being the place where mass was first celebrated in the
Philippines. Toward the end of March, 1521, Magellan discovered this
little island, which then appeared to be a prosperous community. It
was here that Magellan met Raja Calambu and Ciagu, who feasted the
Spaniards and exchanged presents with them. The Island of Leyte itself,
then called Tandaya, was the first island of the Philippine Archipelago
to receive the name of "Felipina."




THE ISLAND OF MINDANAO.--This island is the second largest and
potentially perhaps the richest of the archipelago. It is divided
into seven provinces--Zamboanga, Misamis, Lanao, Bukidnon, Cotabato,
Davao, Agusan, and Surigao.


[Origin of Name]

The term "Mindanao" or "Maguindanao" was originally given to the town
now known as Cotabato and its immediate vicinity. (See page 104.) The
word is derived from the root "danao" which means inundation by a
river, lake, or sea. The derivative "Mindanao" means "inundated"
or "that which is inundated." "Maguindanao" means "that which has
inundated."


[Islam]

Islam was successfully introduced and firmly established in Mindanao by
Sharif Mohammed Kabungsuwan. He is believed to have established himself
in this region toward the end of the fifteenth century. He was also
the founder of the Sultanate so that today most of the inhabitants
of Mindanao are Mohammedans. The Christian population came from the
northern islands. They immigrated into Mindanao to exploit the rich
sections of the islands. They have built their homes along the river
basins and near the bays accessible to commerce. In many cases they
hold the important municipal positions such as tax-collectors and
teachers. The Moros who inhabit the interior valleys have acknowledged
the authority of their Christian brothers from the north and are
living peacefully with them.




THE PROVINCE OF ZAMBOANGA includes the whole of the western peninsula
of the island. The central portion is covered with dense forests
containing much valuable hardwood timber. Abaca and copra are the
principal products though sugar, cacao, hemp, and rice are cultivated
to some extent. Among the important forest products are guttapercha for
insulating cable wires and almaciga for varnish. Basilan Island nearby
is covered with forests, and lumber mills are in operation. There
are also plantations for the growing of rubber in this island.

As a whole the interior of the province is not at present very
accessible, and most of the attractions center in the capital City
of Zamboanga at the extreme end of the peninsula, which is described
on page 65.




COTABATO PROVINCE is in the southwestern portion of Mindanao. The term
"Cotabato" signifies a "stone fort." Cotabato is the capital and is
located near the mouth of the river called Cotabato also. The Cotabato
River system, though not as swift as the Rhine River of Germany,
serves the same purpose to Cotabato as the Rhine to Germany in the
sense that it forms the chief means of communication and transportation
for conveying finished products and raw materials from the different
towns to the coast.

On the valley of this river are some of the most fertile and productive
regions of the whole Philippine Archipelago, although due to the
scarcity of population and of laborers very little cultivation has
been done.

On the eastern side of the valley are many extensive but shallow
swamps, such as the Liguasan and Libungan. Large lakes as Buluan and
Cebu, and many small ones abound. These natural basins yield an immense
wealth for the country. On the marshes, mangroves and nipa grow in
abundance, while the lakes teem with the rarest and choicest fish.


[Attractions]

Sulphur is abundant near and around Mount Apo, an extinct volcano,
9,610 feet high, being the highest peak in the archipelago. The
difficult ascent and the lack of transportation facilities make
exploitation impossible at present. Mineral springs can be found near
the town of Cotabato.

The land is well adopted to the cultivation of coconut and rice. The
mountains are densely wooded. With the exception of the small portion
around Sarangani Bay where logging is being carried on most of the
forested area is not yet exploited. The most important forest products,
which are at present exported in great quantities, are the candlenut,
almaciga, and guttapercha.




[Fertility]

BUKIDNON PROVINCE occupies the great fertile plateau of Mindanao
immediately north of Cotabato. It contains immense areas of fertile
soil unsurpassed for grazing and general farming. There are at
least 300,000 hectares of open grass-covered land which would yield
rich returns under the plow. The Bukidnons themselves, learning to
use modern agricultural implements, are taking advantage of their
opportunities, this being clearly evidenced by the beautiful fields
of corn surrounding their settlements, by the increased plantings
of rice and camotes, and by the great increase in the exportation of
hemp and coffee. The lower levels of Bukidnon produce the best grade
of hemp in northern Mindanao. Corn grows to a height of 13 feet on
the Bukidnon plateaus, the stalks supporting two ears. Two crops may
be grown annually.

There are some Manobos and a few Moros in the province, but the greater
part of the inhabitants are Bukidnons who are timid, peaceable farmers.




LANAO PROVINCE.--Between Bukidnon and Zamboanga is the Province
of Lanao which includes the region centering about the large Lake
of Lanao. It consists for the most part of a plateau (altitude,
about 2,200 feet), with an invigorating climate and fine stretches
of grazing land. The soil is in the main excellent and, at various
altitudes, produces a very great variety of crops, including the
usual staples, some fruits like the "durian," unknown or rare in the
northern islands, coffee, and a variety of wild rubber, for which
plant, in its cultivated form, the district is well adapted.

For many years this valuable country has been the scene of the
lawlessness of the Lanao Moros, but after the institution of civil
government among them they have settled down and are living peacefully
side by side with the immigrants from the northern islands. The same
is true with the other provinces in the Island of Mindanao.

Much of the scenery in the Lanao Province is said to be among the
finest in the world, while the Moros are extremely interesting and
manufacture many small articles of great artistic value, especially
brasswork and weapons.


[Attractions]

Among the attractions is Lake Lanao, believed to have been formed as
a result of the subsidence of the land accompanying the eruption of
the volcanoes in the surrounding country. There are three of these
volcanoes, which are still active. The climate, especially around
Lake Lanao, is very cool. Dansalan nearby is the favorite resort of
the people in the lowlands of Mindanao and bears the promise of being
the Baguio of the southern islands.

Other attractions are the Maria Cristina Falls about 191 feet high
and the Mataling Fall about 40 feet in height, both of which are on
the road to the lake.




DAVAO PROVINCE occupies the southeastern part of Mindanao. Though
perhaps less fertile for some crops than the neighboring Province of
Cotabato, Davao comprises the finest hemp land in the archipelago and
there is a considerable colony of Japanese, American, and Filipino
planters.

More than half of the population, however, are pagans, the Mandayas
and Bagobos predominating in number. These two pagan tribes have the
best primitive civilization among all the non-Christian peoples of
the archipelago. Their women weave excellent cloth which is dyed in
curious and ornamental patterns and the men make daggers, spears,
and other articles of metal.

The town of Davao is the capital and principal port. It is well laid
out and has a number of interesting monuments.




AGUSAN PROVINCE, north of Davao, occupies the whole northern Valley
of Agusan. The soil is of the greatest fertility, holding a constant
moisture. The rainfall is very evenly distributed throughout the year,
and there has been no drought or destructive typhoon recorded. Abaca
and coconuts thrive well in this region. A splendid rice crop is
produced without irrigation. Bananas, papayas, and other tropical
fruits are grown in great abundance, the famous Mindanao papaya
attaining its perfection in the region about Butuan.

The numerous lakes and the extensive area of swampy land are sources
of incalculable wealth. Choicest fish abound in the lakes, while nipa
from which tuba and alcohol are obtained, and mangroves for fuel and
tanning purposes, grow wild in the fenlands.

Gold deposits exist in abundance. Most of these deposits are found
in the mountains on the eastern side of the valley. The location of
these mines is favorable, being near rivers. There are several gold
mining claims at present under operation.

Butuan, the capital and most important town of the province, is near
the mouth of the navigable Agusan River. This river port serves the
same purpose for the settlements built along Agusan River and its
tributaries, as the town of Cotabato to the well-scattered towns of
the Cotabato Valley.




SURIGAO PROVINCE, north of Agusan, occupies the whole northeastern
part of the Island of Mindanao. Abaca, copra, and corn are the
most important agricultural products. There is much fine timber
in the forests, the best obtainable equalling iron and concrete in
durability. Gold is at present mined in some parts of the province.




THE SULU ARCHIPELAGO.--The Sulu Province includes all of the islands of
the Sulu Archipelago, a region which is often visited by earthquakes,
the Sulu Sea being the seismic center. The climate of this region is
warm and moist, being near the equator.

Fishing is the most important industry. Jolo is the center for most of
the pearling fleet. Sitanki, Omapui, Tumindao, Balimbing, Landubas,
Laja, and Siasi are other important fishing centers. The sea turtle,
fish of all kinds, and the trepang are caught. Beautiful trays and
combs and other articles are made from the back of the sea turtle,
and the fish and trepang are cured and exported.

The Sulu Archipelago, especially Jolo, the capital and principal port,
trades with Zamboanga, Borneo, and Singapore. Chinese merchants traded
with Sulu long before the arrival of Legaspi in the Philippines. When
Manila and Cebu were yet small settlements, Jolo was already a city,
the most important in the Philippines.


[Introduction of Mohammedanism]

Mohammedanism was introduced and firmly established in the Archipelago
by three men--Makdum, Raja Baginda, and Abu Bakr. Makdum was a noted
Arabian scholar who, after introducing Mohammedanism into Malacca,
visited almost every island of the Sulu Archipelago toward the end
of the fourteenth century and made numerous converts especially in
Bevansa and Tapul. Raja Baginda, soon after the arrival of Makdum,
came by way of Zamboanga and Basilan. He was of princely rank and is
believed to have come accompanied by ministers of state. He settled
in Bevansa and became the supreme ruler of Sulu. Abu Bakr, who seemed
to have been quite a learned man, arrived in Bevansa about the middle
of the fifteenth century. Here, he lived with Raja Baginda, teaching
the people the Mohammedan religion. He later married Parasimuli, the
daughter of Raja Baginda, and succeeded his father-in-law as sultan.

The reign of Abu Bakr (1450-1480) was noteworthy not only because
of the firm establishment of Mohammedanism, but also because of the
governmental reforms then effected. Abu Bakr reorganized the government
of Sulu, dividing it into five main administrative districts, each
under a Panglima. He promulgated a new code of laws which became the
guide for all officials of the state. During his reign, Sulu's power
was felt not only in Mindanao and the Visayas, but even in Luzon.

The administration of Governor-General Sande (1575-80) was the
beginning of a continuous state of warfare between Spain and Sulu
which lasted to within two decades before the end of the Spanish
rule. Sande wanted to reduce Sulu to a subject state, impose tribute
on its people, secure for the Spaniards the trade of the Archipelago,
and convert the inhabitants to Catholicism. To attain these ends,
he sent Captain Rodriguez de Figueroa to Sulu with a large army. This
expedition, however, accomplished nothing beyond the arousing of the
Sulus to hostility and the inception of numerous Moro raids on the
Visayas and Luzon.


[The Sultan and His Present Position]

The whole Archipelago is still under the nominal sway of the Sultan
of Sulu, who lives in the Island of Jolo and enjoys pensions from
the Philippine Government and the British North Borneo Company. All
of the Moros in Mindanao and in Sulu have long ago recognized the
authority of the central Philippine Government in Manila, and the
hostility which has existed between the Moros and the inhabitants of
the northern islands during Spanish rule, has long passed away. The
policy of attraction inaugurated by the Philippine Government has
succeeded wonderfully. Disturbances among the Moros are now very few
and far between. They have their own senator in the Philippine Senate
and they have their own representatives in the House.


[Results of the Policy of Attraction]

Considering the past history of these southern islands, it is
almost incredible that such results have become possible. Many of
the non-Christians in the interior of Mindanao-Sulu have even changed
their manner of dressing and have adopted the garb of the Christians,
whom they are endeavoring to imitate as much as possible, mingling with
them in their work, and assisting in maintaining law and order. The
Moros themselves have changed a great deal; the juramentado (running
amok) is practically a thing of the past; they show greater religious
tolerance and a high sense of responsibility; they cooperate in every
way possible with the Christians and the Government authorities in
the maintenance of a government of law and order, and do everything
they can to identify themselves with the inhabitants of the north. For
this reason more beneficial and lasting changes have been accomplished
in the last five years, in moral, social, and political respects,
as well as in the material development of the people, than had been
accomplished for several centuries past. This progress is principally
due to the efforts of the Philippine Legislature, which furnished the
Department of Mindanao and Sulu with large annual appropriations and
thus made the policy of attraction a success.


[The town of Jolo]

The town of Jolo is the political and commercial center of the
archipelago and is reached from Manila direct. The trip through
island-studded Sulu Sea, is one of great scenic beauty.

Jolo consists of a picturesque little walled city and a considerable
town outside. The population is cosmopolitan. The town is more
Malayan, more Arabic, and more Oriental than Zamboanga. Thus it has
many attractions for the traveler.

The part within the walls has excellent streets and walks and is
adorned with parks, gardens, and fountains. One of the most curious
sights is furnished by the half-tame deer, which run at large about
the streets. The point of greatest interest in the outer town is the
"Chinese pier," a rickety affair, on which most of the merchants of
that nationality have their shops, both as a measure of safety and
for convenience in handling cargoes. These shops are the best places
to go to for Moro curios.


[Attractions]

The town as a whole is an excellent place in which to see the daily
life and occupations of the Moro people in their most characteristic
forms. The fact that it is the chief center of the pearl fisheries
of the Islands puts the pearling boats when in port, the market where
the pearls and shell are sold, and the places of manufacture and sale
of the shell ornaments, among the principal sights. Leading from the
town to the barracks at Asturias is a fine coconut avenue, known as
"Ariolas' Walk." It is named after its builder, who was the Spanish
military governor of the place in the early years of the last century.




THE LANGUAGE FOR THE TOURIST.--Spanish and English are the languages
universally used in the archipelago. As a general rule, however, an
English speaking tourist can travel in the different places described
in this book without knowledge of any except his mother tongue. Almost
all of the officials and employees of the government speak English
and, if there is no one else, a school child can generally be found
to do the interpreting.


[English-Speaking Filipinos]

Statistics show that there are at present more Filipinos who can
read, write, and speak the English language than those who can read,
write, and speak the Spanish language. The last Census (1918) gives
the following figures:

                                                  Males     Females

  Filipinos of 10 years of age or over who can    563,495   322,359
    read English.
  Those who can read Spanish.                     587,588   292,223
  Those who can both read and write English.      540,552   313,993
  Those who can both read and write Spanish.      454,052   210,270


As a matter of fact the English language serves at the present time
as a common medium of communication among the inhabitants of the
Philippines who still speak their own dialects. Because of the work
of public schools during the last quarter of a century it is the
language which is most widely spoken in the whole Archipelago.

Business between the central government and the provinces and
municipalities is transacted in English. The proceedings of the
Philippine Legislature although still in Spanish, are translated into
English. In commercial transactions the English language prevails
throughout the islands. It will not be very long before the language
will be the official language even in the courts and the language
which is more generally used in private life. The present leaders of
the people have a working knowledge of the language and many can read
and write it fairly. The younger generation has a thorough knowledge
of English and speaks and writes it in most cases.

The spread of the language as the common language of the inhabitants is
assured, not only because it is the basis of instruction in the public
schools and in the universities, but also because it is essential to
the best interest and political future of the people.









X. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS, FOREST RESOURCES, MINERALS, AND
OTHER INDUSTRIES


The Philippines are eminently an agricultural country. Agriculture
is the principal source of the Islands' wealth, and the bulk of the
exports consists mostly of agricultural products.


[Hectares under cultivation]

An estimate of the number of hectares under cultivation during the
year 1922, shows the following:


              Hectares devoted to rice.         1,661,430
              Hectares devoted to abaca.          494,990
              Hectares devoted to sugar-cane.     240,820
              Hectares devoted to coconuts.       422,684
              Hectares devoted to corn.           549,960
              Hectares devoted to tobacco.         59,870
              Hectares devoted to maguey.          27,670
              Hectares devoted to cacao.            1,155
              Hectares devoted to coffee.             882
                                                ---------
                 Total.                         3,459,461


This is only about 10 per cent of the total area of the Islands.

Extensive areas of agricultural lands which remain undeveloped are
the Agusan Valley in eastern Mindanao; the Cotabato Valley in central
Mindanao; sections of the plains of central Luzon and of the Cagayan
Valley; the central plain of Panay and the meadowlands of Palawan,
Samar, and Mindoro. There are also the coastal plains of Zamboanga,
Mindanao, Leyte, and Negros.

The average area of farms in the Islands according to the Census of
1918 is 2.33 hectares, as against 3.47 hectares in 1903.


[Farms owned by Filipinos]

Out of the 1,955,276 farms in the Islands today 1,946,580 or 96 per
cent, are owned by Filipinos, 2,678 by Americans, 949 by Europeans,
1,612 by Asiatics, and 3,457 by other nationalities.


[Exports]

THE PRINCIPAL CROPS.--The principal crops produced by the islands
are rice, abaca (Manila hemp), coconut, sugar, and tobacco. All of
these except rice are articles of export. The following table shows
the respective values of these exports:

Rice is almost exclusively the staple foodstuff of the people; but
corn in some provinces constitutes an important part of the daily
diet. Although the production of rice has been increasing steadily
since 1910 the Philippines has had to import rice from other countries,
especially Indo-China, for a part of its supply. The government is
now exerting every effort towards solving the problem. Immense sums
are being appropriated for the construction of irrigation systems so
indispensable in the successful growing of rice.


[Fibers]

Abaca (Manila hemp).--The Philippines is the only source in the
world for abaca, commercially known as Manila hemp. There are two
other commercial fibers, however, that grow in the islands. These
are sisal and maguey. Although other kind of fibers grow in other
countries especially in Mexico, the world must always use a certain
amount of the Manila hemp for binder twine and for high grade ropes.

Coconuts.--In the production of coconut, the Philippines is the third
most important source in the world. It is excelled only by the Dutch
East Indies and the Federated Malay States. It is estimated that
there are some 84,536,710 trees in the islands which in 1922 produced
366,808,888 kilos of coprax, valued at P44,057,045.

The traveler in Philippine waters always notices along the coast the
extensive groves of coconut palms which extend miles and miles into
the hinterland as far as the eye can reach.


[Uses of the Coconut]

In the Philippines the coconut tree serves many ends. The meat is
eaten as a delicacy. The leaves supply roofing for houses. The shell
of the nut is used for dishes, cups, and spoons; the oil for soap and
illumination; in some sections the same oil is used as a frying fat
for cooking purposes. The fiber from the husk is used for ropes and
mats. The husk itself is used for fuel. The water inside the nut is
an ever-ready delicious drink.

Oleomargarine comes from coconut oil fat, an industry which has
developed considerably in Denmark and Germany and also in the United
States.

Copra, or coprax--Other by-products.--Copra, or coprax as it is
sometimes called, is the dried meat of the ripe coconut. It is
obtained by breaking the nut into halves and drying them in the sun or
artificially in kilns until the nut-meat is separated from the shell.

The exportation of coconut oil from the Philippines since 1913 is
shown in the following table:

[Copra meal]

Another by-product of the coconut oil is known as copra meal. It is
the meal remaining after most of the oil has been expressed. This is
used as cattle feed in Germany and Denmark.


[Soap]

Recently, certain corporations in the Philippines have gone so far
as to use their oil to manufacture many of the varied products which
were formerly made only in the United States and Europe. Soap was the
first product to be manufactured locally. There are two companies now,
however, which manufacture lard substitutes under their own trade
names. There is an attempt also to manufacture coconut butter for
sale in the islands.


[Desiccated Coconut]

The manufacture of desiccated coconut is an infant industry in the
Philippine Islands. The demand for this in Europe and particularly
in the United States is very large and is mostly filled by Ceylon or
by factories in the United States which import the whole nuts from
the West Indies. Last year, however, the desiccated coconut from the
Philippines gained a strong foot-hold in the United States and it
is expected that Ceylon will be ousted from this field in the near
future due to the free trade relations between the United States
and the Philippines. On desiccated coconut imported into the United
States from foreign countries, a duty of 3 1/2 per cent is levied. At
present there are six factories of desiccated coconut in the Islands.


[Coir]

Another opportunity for development lies in the use of coir, the tough
fiber of the husk surrounding the nut. In other countries this is
worked up into door mats, rope, twine, etc., but in the Philippines
the husks are usually burned as fuel except in a few instances where
they are utilized for domestic purposes. It is also possible that
some day other minor parts of the palm may be used. At present the
midribs of the palm leaflets are used in making brooms and baskets,
but the demand for exports is still small.

The exportation of copra from 1913 to 1922 is as follows:

Until the production of copra in the Philippines is much higher
than at present, it will be impossible to keep all the expellers
and presses now installed working at full capacity. It is therefore
proposed to start a campaign for the planting of quick-growing crops
of oil-bearing seeds. Among the plants that were most popular at first
was the tañgan-tañgan, or castor bean. This grows very rapidly and
yields a very high percentage of castor oil, which was sold at high
prices during the war as a lubricant for aeroplanes and other delicate
machinery. At the present writing, however, it is generally thought
that the mills will do better if they can turn to the production of
peanut oil, using imported peanuts to begin with and enlarging the
return as the domestic yield increases.


Sugar.--Cane-sugar ranks first among the islands' agricultural exports.

As early as 1795 the United States have been importing sugar from
the Philippine Islands; for that year 132 long tons were imported.

Up to the middle of the nineteenth century, however, the production of
sugar-cane in the Philippines was confined largely to the provinces of
Luzon near Manila. But shortly after the Crimean war the demand for
sugar in Europe increased, and interest in the industry was greatly
stimulated in the Islands. This resulted in the extension of the
industry into the Visayan Islands, Occidental Negros becoming the
largest cane producing section of the Archipelago, and so continues
until the present day.

As late as 1914 most of the sugar produced in the Islands was
muscovado. It was not until the establishment of modern sugar centrals
that centrifugal sugar was produced. The production of sugar became
so stimulated as a result, and in 1922, as many as 455,404,427 kilos
were produced. There are now 28 sugar centrals in the Islands as
against one in 1910, and several are in process of construction.

Tobacco--The Manila cigar.--The Manila cigar is just as well known
to the world as the Manila hemp. It is among the few manufacturing
enterprises that have developed factory conditions in the Islands.


[History]

For generations the Spaniards conducted the tobacco business in the
Philippines on the basis of Government monopoly. The monopoly came
to an end in 1882 when the Filipino workers defied both the Spanish
government and those directing the work in the factories because of
the harsh and cruel treatment they were getting.

Thereafter, for many years, the tobacco business suffered extreme
depression, and it was not until American occupation that the industry
received anything of a stimulus. The Manila cigar, however, was then
at a disadvantage in comparison with cigars from other countries,
because the latter were allowed a discount from the tariff, while
the Manilas were required to pay the full customs duty.

With the establishment of free trade, however, between the islands
and the United States the Manila cigar has been able to compete
with other cigars in the United States, by far the greatest market
therefor. This fact accounts for the unprecedented steady increase of
the amount of cigars exported from the islands. In 1904 the exports
amounted to 104,753,000 cigars, valued at P2,011,790. In 1919 the
exports had risen to 392,339,000 worth P18,157,707.


[The Tobacco Region]

Although tobacco is grown in many parts of the islands, all that which
is exported comes from the Provinces of Cagayan, Isabela, and Nueva
Vizcaya, in northern Luzon. All grown elsewhere is consumed locally,
also exported to European and other countries. The tobacco growing
districts in these three provinces lie in the valley of the Cagayan
River, a stream which is about 160 miles long. The valley is from 2
to 14 miles wide. During the rainy season, which is between the time
that one crop is harvested and the next one planted, the Cagayan River
rises to a height of 40 feet inundating all of the lowlands. This
overflow never fails, and it always leaves on the valley a deposit
of rich soil, renewing the fertility of the entire valley and making
the use of fertilizers unnecessary. On one field in Cagayan Valley,
crops have been produced without interruption and without fertilizer
for one hundred and thirty-five years.


[Government control and Guaranty]

No cigar in the world today is produced under such carefully prepared
and rigidly enforced regulations as the Manila cigar. The Philippine
government has assumed control of the industry, has established
invariable standards of excellence, and has guaranteed the production
under its own official stamp. If you will examine the next box of
Manila cigars you see, you will find that it bears a label stating
that its contents are guaranteed by the Philippine government. One of
the regulations enforced provides that, under certain limitations,
cigars which reach the American dealer in a damaged condition may
be returned to the Philippines at the expense of the Philippine
government. Another regulation is to the following effect:


    "To be up to the standard established by the Government,
    Philippine cigars are required to be made from good, clean,
    selected tobacco, properly cured and seasoned, exclusively the
    product of the Provinces of Cagayan, Isabela, and Nueva Vizcaya,
    well made with suitable spiral wrapper and with long filler from
    which must have been removed all stems dust, scrap or sun-burned
    tobacco; cigars to be properly assorted and packed in clean
    receptacles of wood not before used, manufactured from native
    wood known as Calantas or from imported cedar. No cigars made
    between sunset and sunrise may be graded as standard."


[The Cigar Factories]

The factories in which the Manila cigars are made are worth
visiting. They are counted among the show-places of the city. Visitors
are always welcome and given an opportunity to follow the entire
process of manufacture from the time the bales of tobacco reach the
warehouses until the finished cigars are packed in air-tight cases
for shipment to all parts of the world.

In these factories every precaution is taken to guard against dirt
and disease. No one is employed except after a searching physical
examination and thereafter all the employees are regularly examined
twice a month. Every now and then, government inspectors visit the
factories, and these have a right to condemn a lot of cigars which
they do not think is up to the standard.

No scraps of any kind are used in the making of Manila cigars. There
are no broken leaves and no dust. There is nothing in the cigar but
long, clean leaves of tobacco. The Manila cigar is the mildest made. It
is the most pleasant and satisfying smoke that can be had at any price.

SECONDARY FOOD PRODUCTS.--Corn leads in importance among the
secondary food products. In 1918 there were 1,035,067 acres grown to
corn producing 11,269,258 bushels valued at $10,686,061. The other
food crops worth mentioning under this heading are sweet potatoes,
cassava, sesame, mongoes, peanuts, bananas, mangoes, citrus, lanzones,
and a great number of tropical fruits and vegetables. Including the
edible algæ and fungi there are more than 100 species of plants in
the Philippines, either wild or cultivated, that find a place in
the dietary system of the people. So rich is the country in food
producing plants.




PROSPECTIVE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRIES.--The plants from which the various
other tropical staple products in the world's markets are derived,
such as rubber, coffee, tea, cacao, pepper, cinchona, and cassava are
all known to thrive well in the Philippines, although the growing of
those enumerated is yet of comparatively little importance. Rubber
has the greatest future of these. The great Island of Mindanao,
which is outside the typhoon zone, has been found to be suitable
to the growing of rubber. All the large rubber plantations of the
Philippines are located on Mindanao or the adjacent Island of Basilan.

During the early years of American occupation, when the acreage
planted to rubber in other countries increased by leaps and bounds,
the erroneous impression somehow gained ground that the Philippines
were unsuited to rubber. And it is not very many years ago that a
planter was able to demonstrate beyond doubt that rubber could be
grown in the Islands successfully. The company he heads now has some
80,000 rubber trees planted. The success of its operations has induced
others to plant rubber, and while the Philippine output of rubber is
still insignificant, it may be said that the rubber industry has come
to stay.




IRRIGATION.--Irrigation has been practiced in the Philippines in some
form for centuries, for, in general, it may be said that the certainty
of a rice harvest depends upon irrigation to supplement the natural
rainfall. When the rainfall is copious and well distributed during the
rice growing season, there is little demand for artificial irrigation
but in the event of a drought or irregular rainfall irrigation
has to be used to insure a normal rice crop. With irrigation it is
also possible to grow two crops of rice a year, whereas without it
the planting of one is often hazardous. Prior to 1908 very little
attention was given to the development of irrigation systems so that
the only irrigation works constructed were by private and communal
enterprise. These old systems are found in different parts of the
Islands, the most notable being the extensive systems with permanent
dams, tunnels, and ditches constructed by the friars and the remarkable
side hill terraces built by the mountain people in the subprovince
of Ifugao.

Studies of irrigation possibilities have now advanced sufficiently to
warrant the Bureau of Public Works recommending a ten-year program for
the construction of 40 irrigation systems in 20 of the principal rice
producing provinces to water an area of approximately 750,000 acres. It
is estimated that these 40 systems will cost about $25,000,000. With
these systems completed and operating, there will be no further need
of importing rice from other countries.




[Rural Credit]

RURAL CREDIT ASSOCIATIONS.--The Rural Credit Law has removed
the restriction in the Corporation Law requiring P200,000 paid-in
capital before a bank may be started. Under the new law, associations
may incorporate with a paid-in capital as low as P100 or as high as
P10,000. The Government does not furnish any financial help except that
the organizing staff is paid and maintained by it. To give security
to small investors the bonded municipal treasurer acts as treasurer
ex-officio of the association and Government auditors audit its books.

The purpose of the Rural Credit Law is to encourage small farmers to
coöperate and furnish their own capital. Only one association may be
incorporated in a municipality to avoid rivalry and factions.

On October 19, 1916, the first rural credit association was
incorporated, and after practically six years, there are now 544
incorporated associations with a paid-in capital of P807,178.

FOREST RESOURCES

[Area]

The forests of the Philippines cover about 18,706,093 hectares, or
72,224 square miles, which is about 63.1 per cent of the total area of
the Archipelago. Of these number, 16,609,108 hectares or 64,127 square
miles, 88.6 per cent of the entire forest area are of a commercial
character. In addition, there are estimated to be about 2,096,985
hectares, or 8,096 square miles of second growth forests which will
yield large quantities of fine wood and small size timber. It is
said that taken together, the virgin and second growth forests in the
Islands cover an area about equal to the area of the State of Nebraska.


[Ownership]

More than 99 per cent of the timber belongs to the Philippine
government and is under the administrative control of the Bureau
of Forestry. Less than 1 per cent is held under title of private
ownership.


[Volume of Timber Resource]

The volume of this timber resource of the Philippines is
192,000,000,000 board feet or 777,000,000 cubic meters. Most of
the timber belong to the dipterocarp family. The largest reach
about 200 feet in height and some specimens have a diameter of 7
feet. The well-known woods of this family are tanguile, red lauan,
almon, apitong, guijo, and yakal. These woods have found favorable
acceptance in the markets of China and the United States.

Next to the dipterocarp family is the molave family. Among the woods of
this family are aranga, duñgon, and molave. There are about 1,036,000
hectares of this timber with a total volume of 7,680,000,000 board
feet. These woods are appropriate for railway ties and for building
construction purposes.


[Timber Output and Export]

The timber output of the islands was 184,628 cubic meters in 1911;
297,094 cubic meters in 1914; 385,150 cubic meters in 1918 and 630,973
in 1922. It is said that this output can be trebled, even quadrupled,
without exhausting the supply for several hundred years.

The export of timber in 1914 was 27,070 cubic meters valued at
P681,272; for 1916, 40,164 cubic meters worth P1,030,276; for 1919,
15,704 cubic meters worth P791,823 and for 1922, 43,008 cubic meters
worth P1,656,812.

The lumber industry in the islands offers many advantages. The
government charges are nominal, ranging from P2.00 to P10.00 per
1,000 board feet according to class. Logging and sawmill equipment
and machinery enter free of duty if imported from the United States
and only 15 per cent duty, if bought from other countries. For fuel,
sawmill waste can be utilized. Water power is available from streams
in a number of places.


[Obtaining a Tract of Timber]

The public forests of the Philippines are not sold, but are developed
under a license system. Small operators usually work under ordinary
yearly licenses for definite small areas. Exclusive licenses, or
concessions as they are popularly called, are generally in the form
of a twenty-year exclusive license to cut and extract timber and
other forest products from a specified tract. The land itself is in
no way affected by such a license. Only the timber and minor forest
products are included.


[Sawmills]

At present there are about 50 sawmills of all sizes and descriptions
operating in the Islands. About 12 of these can be compared to the
average modern sawmills in the United States. The largest sawmills
are located on timber concessions, while the others are operated under
short-term licenses. The total cut of the sawmills of the Philippine
Islands is about 100 to 130 million board feet per year.




MINOR FOREST PRODUCTS.--This term includes all products of the forest
except timber or lumber. Many of the minor forest products of the
Philippines are at present almost unknown in the world's markets and
are largely confined to local use.

The most important are nipa, sugar, and alcohol; rattan, used in
making furniture; Manila copal or almaciga, used in making high
grade varnish; lumbang, a nut-producing high grade oil for varnish;
dye-woods and barks; guttapercha and rubber; paper pulp; fibers
suitable for making baskets, hats, mats, ropes, etc.; soap barks;
pili nuts, declared by many as superior even to almonds; wax; and
different kinds of medicinal plants.




MINERALS

The Islands are rich in mineral products, and it should not be long
before the working of minerals should constitute one of its basic
industries. The most important minerals are gold, silver, lead,
zinc, copper, iron, coal, petroleum, sulphur, asphalt, asbestos,
manganese, guano, mineral waters, gas, cement, and many others of
minor importance.


Gold.--There are a number of successful gold mines in the islands
today. One of them is the Colorado mine in Masbate which produces
P2,000 worth of gold a day at a cost of P1,000. Other successful mines
are those of Paracale, Ambos Camarines; Baguio, Mountain Province;
and Aroroy, Masbate. There are large areas of placer ground in Nueva
Ecija, Mindanao, and Misamis.

According to an estimate of the Bureau of Science, there are in all
800 to 1,000 square kilometers of placer grounds in the Philippines
still undeveloped. The production of gold in 1916 was 2,265,789 fine
grams, worth P3,011,755; in 1918 the production was 1,937,941 fine
grams valued P2,575,970.


Silver.--Silver is found alloyed with the gold in all of the gold
deposits in the ratio of 1 to 4. No attempt has as yet been made
to develop the silver mines of the islands. There is no doubt,
however, that the silver deposits can be advantageously developed
on a commercial basis because the supply of silver in the world is
declining and because the neighboring countries, such as China and
Japan, are on the silver standard basis.


Iron.--Valuable deposits of high grade iron ores are found in the
eastern and southeastern cordilleras of Luzon. Extensive deposits are
available in Bulacan, Rizal, Camarines, and Surigao. The Surigao field
has a total area of 100 square kilometers with an average depth of
3 meters. The total estimated iron-ore deposit is about 500,000,000
tons. This region is accessible from the coast. The Bulacan deposit
contains approximately 1,200,000 tons of ore. No survey has been
made of other fields, but it is estimated that at least another
500,000,000 tons of ore are dormant in them. If properly developed,
these deposits would yield sufficient ore to meet the local needs for
iron and steel products, perhaps with a surplus for exportation. As
a result of the economic development of the country, the importation
of iron and steel and their manufactures has shown an annual tendency
to increase, as may be seen from the following figures:

                           1921    43,529,079
                           1922    15,208,761


The demand for iron and steel goods in the Philippines is bound
to remain on the ascendant with the daily increase in the use
of structural iron and steel for Government buildings as well as
for private structures. Here again is another vast field awaiting
exploitation by enterprising men and capital.


Manganese.--Manganese deposits are found in Ilocos Norte, Pangasinan,
Bulacan, Tarlac, Masbate, and Benguet. Little, if anything, seems to
have been done in the way of developing them. This mineral product
is of great industrial value and has a sure demand on the world's
market. The United States in 1914 imported 288,306 tons of this
product, and in 1917, 656,088 tons, valued at P21,000,000.


Coal.--No other mineral deposits are as widely scattered in almost
every island of the Archipelago as coal. Extensive deposits which
would warrant investments of capital are found in Cebu, Polillo,
Mindanao, Masbate, and Mindoro. According to estimates made by the
Bureau of Science the probable minimum tonnage of the different grades
of coal found in this country is about 68,000,000 metric tons. Tests
made by the same bureau show the following figures on the comparative
calorific value of imported and local coal:

At present only the Cebu coal fields are extensively developed. The
latest data on coal production in the Philippines are 5,407 metric tons
for 1917; about 20,000 metric tons for 1918; 40,011 for 1921 and 36,939
for 1922. [1] The importations from 1908 to 1922 were as follows:

OTHER INDUSTRIES


Fishing.--Philippine waters abound in food fishes of all
kinds. However, the amount of fish caught is not even enough to meet
the local demand. Fishing is mostly done in shallow water, the methods
employed not being adequate for deep-sea fishing. There is great need
for modern equipment for purposes of deep-sea fishing. The islands
are still a heavy importer of fish products. The City of Manila alone
consumes P4,000,000 worth of fresh fish a year.

There are various sea products of the islands, which can be profitably
exploited, such as oysters and other shell fish. Raw materials for
canning purposes are available. Oil and tomatoes could easily be
procured that possess good preserving qualities.


Alcohol.--For the manufacture of alcohol the Philippines offer an
abundant supply of raw materials. There is the nipa sap from nipa
palms which are found in extensive groves in water swamps. There is
the discarded molasses from the sugar mills amounting annually to
7,000,000 gallons. There are fruits, especially bananas, which could
be grown in unlimited quantities and manufactured into alcohol. To
these, may be added wood-waste and sawdust from the lumber mills.


Cordage.--The manufacture of cordage is another profitable Philippine
industry with the promise of a constant world demand. The islands
have all the natural advantages for the extensive development of
the industry. Abaca, sisal, and maguey affording strong fibers can
be grown in abundance. At present the islands are an exporter of
cordage. In 1915, 454,621 kilograms were exported; in 1918 the export
rose to 2,209,064 kilograms valued at P1,733,968, in 1921 the export
2,631,953 kilos valued at P1,099,378. Most of this was exported to
British East Indies, Hongkong and the United States.


Paper and paper pulp.--The industry which for some time has interested
the Government and private individuals, and for the development of
which nothing substantial so far has been accomplished, is the paper
and paper pulp industry. There is at present a large demand for
paper pulp in America, Europe, and Japan. According to authorities
on the subject, the spruce wood, which forms at least two-thirds of
all the woods converted into pulp, is being exhausted. Very recently
newspapers in the United States gave accounts of plans to develop the
forest resources of Alaska to supply paper pulp for the production of
paper. The world's annual paper production is about 8,000,000 tons,
and it is estimated that for every ten years there is an increase in
demand amounting to 25 per cent.

The Bureau of Science has made an exhaustive study of raw materials
available in the Philippines for the manufacture of paper pulp. The
investigation shows that there is an abundant supply of raw materials
for the manufacture of paper. Among these are bamboo (caña bojo
variety), cogon grass, and abaca waste. These materials contain all
the elements for the manufacture of an excellent pulp product. The
supply of bamboo and cogon grass is almost unlimited thruout the
Islands. Bamboo fiber is eminently fitted for the manufacture of pulp
used for the making of book papers and for certain grades of writing
and lithographic materials.


Cattle raising.--There are extensive grass lands suitable for cattle
raising in the islands. Seventy five per cent of the country is a
rolling expanse of upland territory to the foot-hills with an elevation
of 4,500 feet. Aside from forest areas, there are extensive pasture
lands such as the grass-covered hills of Nueva Vizcaya, the Mountain
Province, and the green plateaus of Bukidnon in Mindanao. There are
now cattle raising projects in those places but there is plenty of
room left elsewhere.

Embroidery.--Hand embroidery in the Philippine Islands has been known
for over four centuries, having been introduced by Spanish, French,
and Belgian nuns, who taught this artcraft to the Filipino women
in their convents where exquisitely fine work was done, mainly for
Church altars and tapestries used for decorations.

At the present time there are scattered over the Islands, but chiefly
in central Luzon, thousands of men, women and children engaged in
this enterprise, which is a means of adding to their income, but is
not considered the mainstay of their livelihood, as they work only
when they prefer to and not of necessity.

France and Belgium, where the embroidery industry was crippled by
the war, are coming back into the field, but it is a question whether
they will ever again be able to compete with the Philippine Islands
in the quality and price of goods. The Filipinos also excel in fine
art work done on piña (pineapple fabric) and silk.

In the Philippines, embroidery is a part of the curriculum of all the
schools, so that every girl student learns how to embroider from an
early age.

The demand for Philippine embroideries greatly exceeds the supply. At
present the greatest demand is for ladies' underwear, but there is also
a tremendous demand for infants' and children's underwear and fine
frocks. The making of children's dresses, especially in the larger
sizes, is probably the most complicated of all handmade merchandise,
not only in the fine embroidery stitchery but also in the cutting
and sewing. This class of workmanship is finding favor by leaps and
bounds in the United States.


[Embroidery Factories]

There are about forty embroidery factories in Manila, the entire output
of which is practically absorbed by the United States. Recently new
markets have opened up, notably India, Australia, and China, where
the dainty work of the Filipino women has been much admired.

The following figures show the growth of the embroidery industry of
the Philippines during the years indicated:

Perfumes.--The Orient, since the most ancient times, has been famous
for perfumes, and in this regard the Philippines are not behind from
other oriental countries. Over two scores of aromatic oils from
plants have been studied by the Bureau of Science and found to be
available for perfumery and medicine; and, as exploration progresses,
undoubtedly others will become better known.


Ilang-ilang.--At least one Philippine essential oil, namely
ilang-ilang, has enjoyed a world-wide fame among perfumes for several
years. Although the oil is extracted also from the flowers of the
same tree in other oriental countries, the Philippine product always
has brought and still does bring the highest prices in the perfume
trade in Europe.


Patchouli oil.--Another oil that has been known in the Orient for
thousands of years and in Europe for centuries is patchouli oil. This,
while of no commercial importance in the Philippines at present,
has a peculiar interest to the botanist, for while the plant is
cultivated in many parts of the Orient in considerable quantities,
there is no record of its flowering except in the Philippines.


Rattan.--The thirty odd kinds of rattans, and the climbing members
of the palm family, furnish strips and reeds for the manufacture of
furniture. Considerable exports in rattan were made during the war;
and, should the rattan be prepared and graded in a manner similar
to what is being done in Singapore, this item of export alone would
not only be increased, but much higher prices would be received for
the product. Rattan strips are used in enormous quantities all over
the Islands as tying material for houses, bridges, wharfs, boats,
fish weirs, and so forth, besides being almost the only material
used for tying bales of Manila hemp, tobacco, sugar bags, and similar
commercial packages.


Shoes.--The shoe industry in the Philippines is in its infant
stage. The exportation during 1919 was only 2,368 pairs of leather
shoes and 674 pairs of canvas shoes, worth P20,695 and P2,351,
respectively. Shoes, however, that left the Islands through the
military, probably worth more than the amount given, are not
included. On the other hand over P5,000,000 worth of shoes of all
kinds were imported in 1919.

There are two factories in the City of Manila manufacturing shoes by
machinery. Filipino laborers are employed and have proved competent to
undertake all phases of the manufacture of shoes. These factories are
making shoes that compare very favorably with the better-grade shoes
made in the United States, using only the best imported leathers and
other necessary materials from the United States. The two factories
have a capacity of about one thousand pairs of shoes per day.

Besides the two factories mentioned, there is also a considerable
quantity of shoes manufactured in small shops throughout the City of
Manila and the provinces that make their shoes entirely by hand and
use a great deal of material produced in the Philippines, especially
sole leather and portions of the upper leathers. These small shops
turn out products of good quality and make most of their shoes on
individual orders.


Hats.--The making of Philippine hats is almost a household
industry. Hats manufactured here are as durable and as beautiful as
those produced in Panama. Philippine buntal, buri, hemp, and bamboo
hats make attractive and comfortable wear. The towns of Baliuag,
Bulacan, and Lucban, Tayabas, have become famous for the excellent
hats they produce.

The hat industry in the Philippines, although exploited only to a
small extent, made it possible for the Islands to record exportation
on this product in 1919 amounting to 1,470,026 pesos as compared with
only 753,942 pesos worth of hats imported for the same year.

Of the 1,470,026 pesos' worth of hats sent out of the Islands in
1919, 1,280,968 pesos' worth went to the United States. With the
increasing popularity which Philippine hats enjoy in the American
market, hat exportation to the United States is expected to reach
greater proportions. China, with its hundreds of millions of souls,
many of whom have already begun to wear hats, is also a big potential
market for this Philippine product.

There is one large hat factory in the Philippines which manufactures
straw hats, wool hats, and also umbrellas. Its actual annual production
reaches half a million straw hats and half a million woolen hats.


Matches.--There is one match factory in the Philippines which
supplies a portion of the local need, averaging 70,000 to 80,000
tins annually. One tin contains 1,440 small boxes. This factory has
been in operation since eighteen years ago. The Philippines imported
last year matches worth 949,205 pesos, while its exports of the same
product were only 33,207 pesos.


Pearls.--Pearls abound in Philippine waters, especially in the
neighborhood of Mindanao and Sulu. The Japanese go as far as Sulu to
fish for pearls. Merchants from Paris and London come to the Islands
to get their supply of pearls.

Until 1910 the pearl industry of the Philippines was totally in
the hands of Moros and Chinese in Mindanao, who sent their pearls
directly to Singapore for sale. After that year jewelry houses in
England and France sent their representatives here to purchase pearls,
and since then large quantities have been shipped directly to those
countries. At present not even one per cent of the pearls fished in
Philippine waters remains in the Islands. The rest are shipped out of
the country to be manufactured into beautiful jewels, which are sent
back to the Islands to be sold at high prices. In 1919 the Islands
exported raw pearls valued at 152,543 pesos, while the manufacture
pearls that were imported were worth 155,150 pesos.


Buttons.--The raw materials used for the manufacture of shell buttons
are trocha, pearl shell, green snail, and the chambered-nautilus. The
Islands have an abundant supply of these shells. They are found in the
waters of Jolo and also in the vicinity of Sitanki, and the regions
farther north, such as the Tañon Strait and along the coasts of most
of the Visayan Islands; some are found along the coasts of Pangasinan
and Ambos Camarines.

In 1918 the United States alone imported 2,500,000 pesos' worth of
buttons; the Philippine exports of this product showed only 251,144
gross in quantity, valued at 231,811 pesos; while the Islands imported
buttons worth 119,787 pesos. Japan is supplying one-half of the button
importation of America. In 1922, imports were valued at P216,086.

There are two button factories in the Philippines. These two companies
use only a very small portion of the suitable material that could be
obtained. The annual supply of shells which the Philippines produces
is 1,000,000 kilograms. The two local factories use less than 300,000
kilograms a year. This limited local demand for shell and the better
prices offered abroad result in the Philippine supply of shells being
exported to other lands.

It is estimated that a small button factory, destined only for the
local trade and capable of producing fifty gross of buttons daily,
would require an investment of about 20,000 pesos, exclusive of the
cost of buildings.




PUBLIC LANDS

There are approximately 73,214,742 acres of public land in the
Philippine Islands.

Of this area 41,029,900 acres are considered suitable for agriculture,
while the total area applied for as homesteads, lease, and sale
concession amounts to only 3,159,712 acres. There are still 37,870,188
acres of agricultural domain that have not yet been appropriated.

In the Province of Cotabato alone on the great Island of Mindanao,
there are still 3,578,169 acres of agricultural public land not
yet occupied nor applied for, and in the Province of Samar, one of
the Visayan group, 2,524,388 acres. In the Island of Mindanao and
the Sulu Archipelago may also be found some of the most suitable
agricultural lands for growing rubber, hemp, coconut, rice, tobacco,
and other staple products, which are available to the farmers at
practically no expense. The various modes of acquiring public land
are explained below.


Homestead.--Any citizen of the Philippine Islands or of the United
States, over the age of 18 years, or the head of a family, who does not
own more than 59 acres of land in the Philippines may enter a homestead
of not exceeding 59 acres of agricultural land of the public domain.

Upon the filing of an application and approval thereof by the Director
of Lands, possession may be taken of the land applied for upon payment
of $5 as entry fee.

The certificate or patent is issued after the land has been improved
and cultivated. The period granted by law to homesteaders for the
improvement and cultivation of their claims is from two to five years
from and after the date of the approval of the application. After an
applicant has complied with all the requirements of the law and the
regulations promulgated in accordance therewith, he will be entitled
to a patent upon payment of an additional amount of $5, thus making
the total homestead fee $10; and small as this amount is, the law
gives the homesteader the option to pay for it in annual installments.


Sale of public land.--Any citizen of lawful age of the Philippine
Islands or of the United States, and any corporation or association of
which at least 61 per centum of the capital stock or of any interest in
said capital stock belongs wholly to citizens of the Philippine Islands
or of the United States may purchase any tract of public agricultural
land of not to exceed 247 acres in the case of an individual and 2,530
acres in that of a corporation or association. Citizens of countries
the laws of which grant to citizens of the Philippine Islands the
same right to acquire public land as to their own citizens, may,
while such laws are in force, but not thereafter, with the express
authorization of the Legislature, purchase any parcel of agricultural
land, not in excess of 247 acres.

Lands sold in this way must first be appraised by the Director of Lands
with the approval of the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources
and then sold at public auction. An individual may purchase as much
as 247 acres of land and a corporation 2,530 acres and, in addition,
lease 2,530 acres.


Lease of public lands.--Another manner of occupying public land
is by leasing it. The same conditions required for citizenship of
individuals and corporations for the purchase of public lands are
laid down regarding leasing public lands, the only exception being
that an individual may lease as much as 2,530 acres whereas under
the law he may purchase only 247 acres.

The annual rental of lease must be at least equal to three per cent of
the appraised valuation of the land, which is subject to reappraisal
every 10 years from the date of the approval of the contract. Lease
contracts run for 25 years but may be renewed for another period of
not to exceed 25 years. In case the lessee shall have made important
improvements which, in the discretion of the Secretary of Agriculture
and Natural Resources, justify a renewal of the lease, a further
renewal for an additional period not to exceed 25 years may be granted.


Friar lands.--The Philippine Government has another kind of land
holdings commonly called "Friar Lands." These were formerly estates
belonging to the religious corporation which were acquired by the
Government for $7,239,784.16.

Any person of legal age may purchase not to exceed 39 acres of the
"Friar Lands" estate. A corporation duly registered in the Philippine
Islands may purchase as much as 2,530 acres.

Payment for the land may be made in full at the time of the purchase
or in annual installments. If purchased on the installment plan the
purchaser is allowed 12 years in which to pay the purchase price,
beginning January first of the year following the purchase, plus
interest of four per cent per annum on the unpaid balance.

After the purchaser has paid for the land applied for by him in full
a deed is issued in his favor.









XI. THE TRADE OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS


[Background]

The Philippines are practically alone among tropical countries in
having, through a fortunate chain of historical circumstances, a
population advanced in civilization and able to become a part of the
complicated organization which modern commerce demands. The business
machinery of collecting the products from the plantations and getting
them to Manila has long been in the hands of Filipinos and in this
they are rarely assisted financially by Americans or foreigners. In
connection with man power, however, there is a problem very difficult
to solve--the scarcity of manual labor--the population of the Islands
being insufficient to till their fertile acres and get their products
ready for commerce. Probably only time can remedy this.

The stability of the Government of the Islands during a time of
growing Filipino participation is a proof to the world that when
the time comes for the government to be entirely in the hands of
the Island's inhabitants, both as to internal and external affairs,
foreign commerce need not fear for loss of credit or trade, due to
any of the great political upheavals which have been so common in
other countries which were once colonies but are now independent.


[Trade Routes]

ECONOMIC POSITION.--Lying within thirty-six hours' sailing from the
port of Hongkong, the Philippine Archipelago bears promise of being
an important distributing center for goods destined for the markets
of the Far East. The ports and harbors have exceptional advantages of
anchorage, and port facilities are easily obtained. The islands are
close to the main trade route between America and Europe, via the
Pacific. They are also close to the route from the extreme Orient
to Europe and to the route from the ports of southern Asia to the
two Americas. Furthermore, they lie on one of the most promising
trade routes between Australia and Asia. Manila, however, is in
competition with such ports as Hongkong, Singapore, Saigon, and
Batavia, which are in most respects better situated especially for
European trade. As regards American bound traffic, however, Manila has
the advantage. Feeder lines are actually operated from Singapore to
Manila and Zamboanga, and from Batavia to the ports of Mindanao. For
goods coming from the United States for the east, direct sailings are
conveniently made from the Pacific coast of Canada to the ports of
the Philippine Islands, where transhipments can be made for any of
the ports of Asia, Japan, India, Singapore, the Dutch East Indies,
and even Australasia.


[Filipino capital]

The port of Manila has now a marine terminal that can compare favorably
with any in the Orient. There are three piers provided with modern
conveniences, and there is a good-sized basin inclosed with strong
breakwater. If the development of the Philippine resources, however,
should in the future proceed as rapidly as the development during
the last decade, and if shipping opportunities generally in the
East are taken advantage of, there will be need for a still larger
marine terminal and for efficient ship-repairing and dry-docking
facilities. But there will always be available sites on Manila Bay.

To emphasize the importance of Manila as a trade center, attention is
drawn to the chart of page 146 where a circle, drawn with Manila as a
center and having a radius of 1,700 miles, will comprise within its
circumference no less than 20 cities of equal importance and would
reach a population of no less than 125,740,711, while a radius of
3,500 miles would make the circumference of the circle reach into the
interior of Siberia and China to the north, all of India and Colombo
to the west, and about two-thirds of Australia to the South.


[Filipino capital]

THE PERSONNEL OF PHILIPPINE COMMERCE.--Before the coming of
the Spaniards, the Filipino people were known traders, their
interisland life leading naturally to a use of the sea as a means of
communication. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries trade was
controlled by the Spanish residents. The result of limited Filipino
participation was a disinclination, through lack of knowledge and
practice, to engage in trade, and it is only within the last few years
that Filipino business men have been an appreciable factor. Dozens
of enterprising and well-educated young men are now venturing into
business. Filipino capital has hitherto been invested in great
estates; the millionaires of the Islands with few exceptions have
obtained their incomes from rentals and produce. All that is rapidly
changing; oil companies, shipping firms, and importing houses are
now financed by Filipino capital and managed by Filipino brains;
but Filipino participation in the trade of their country has not yet
assumed commanding proportions.


[Foreigners]

The people of all the great trading nations have established houses
in Manila and have a vital part of the Islands' commerce, transacting
a considerably greater proportion of the foreign trade. Of these,
Americans are, of course, the most numerous, having as a basis the
political bond between the two countries. A large part of these
are ex-Government employees, who saw the opportunities for business
development during their terms of service in the Insular Government.

The British probably occupy second place, though the Spaniards and
their descendants in the Islands are important factors, their houses
handling every branch of import and export trade. The British firms
are for the most part long established, and their trade has the strong
aspect characteristic of British trade the world over. They specialize
in the export of the staples hemp, sugar, and tobacco. The French and
Swiss have houses, which were here prior to American occupation. The
Japanese are a new element; they have of late been invading every
branch of commerce, with increasing momentum. Millions of Japanese
capital are being invested in the basic industries of the Islands,
and each month sees the incorporation of new companies. The post-war
depression, however, has reduced their number and commercial activities
very materially.


AMERICA'S MONOPOLY IN PHILIPPINE TRADE.--The old saying that "trade
follows the flag" has held true in the Islands. At the time of the
American occupation a very small portion of the Islands' commerce was
with the United States; now it is about two-thirds, seven times that
of any other country.

In the beginning, the growth was slow, and what growth there
was, was due to the increasing American civil population. The few
American houses were young and struggling with inexperience and lack
of capital. The older foreign houses, with their branches in the
provincial centers and established clientele, had a very strong hold
on import trade.


[Effect of Free Trade]

In 1909 a tariff law providing for reciprocal free trade between the
United States and the Islands was passed, with a few limitations which
were removed in 1913. Immediately following the passage of this law
American goods sprang to the fore and trade increased threefold from
1909 to 1912, $24,000,000 worth having been imported in that year.




MEDIUMS OF TRADE.--Generally speaking, there are three methods by
which goods coming from foreign countries are brought to consumers
in the Archipelago.

Some manufacturers establish branches throughout the Islands and
sell only their particular line. For others having a smaller volume
of trade various commission and indent houses stand ready to handle
their goods together with other lines. Still other manufacturers
having a large volume of business in the Islands transact business
thru a branch or agent direct without any intermediary.

of trade between the Philippines and the other countries of the
world for the years 1917 to 1922:

Because the products of the Islands are usually exported to the
countries where the imports come from, there have been established
firms which deal in exports and imports of every variety, and have
buying and selling organization both in the Islands and abroad. This
double business, so to speak, besides being very profitable, lends
itself to large scale enterprises and millions of capital have been
brought together under one managing head.




SHIPPING.--The foreign, as well as the domestic trade of the
Philippines, will always depend on an adequate supply of shipping. As
fast as the agriculture and industries of the Islands develop, the
supply of shipping must correspondingly increase, otherwise, the
commercial development of the Islands will be retarded. Hemp, oil,
and sugar are bulky and the surface they require when exported is
large in proportion to their value. Practically, all Philippine goods
are carried thousands of miles before they reach their destinations,
either to New York or London and the continent--half way around the
world. Because of this, reasonable wages and a regular supply of
surface for cargo in the ships calling at the ports of the Islands
are indispensable. Because of this, also, it is necessary for the
Islands to have a merchant marine of its own in order that products
therefrom can be easily transported to the markets of the world.




INTERISLAND TRANSPORTATION.--Water transportation is the key to the
interisland trade of the Islands. For hundreds of years before the
coming of the steamboat, the Philippine seas were dotted with small
sailboats of every description, made out of a log, or of rough hewn
planks surmounted by a sail made from abaca cloth. They were manned
by sturdy, courageous voyagers inured to hardships, who dared to go
forth even into strange oceans, through typhoon and tempest.

Not until the coming of the cargo steamer, however, could the bulky
products of the Islands be gathered together in large quantities and
become an important factor in the world's commercial necessities. Every
portion of the Islands is now covered by steamers, plying regular
routes.


[Interisland Lines]

To the north a route leads to Aparri, the outlet from the fertile
Cagayan Valley, a tobacco country, where thousands of hectares of rich
unoccupied prairies await only the touch of capital. To the southward
are the main channels of trade. Cebu is the metropolis of the Southern
Islands, and to this port come the hemp and copra of all the Visayas,
there to be transferred to Manila. Some ocean liners load direct at
Cebu for the homeward voyage, saving the haul to Manila. Cebu harbor
accommodates vessels of 30-foot draft, which can anchor at the sea
wall, close to the warehouses of the principal commercial houses. From
Iloilo comes the sugar of Negros and Panay. Here, too, is a harbor of
sufficient depth to allow ocean vessels of fair tonnage to load. Ships
of the Spanish lines in particular are accustomed to procure their
cargoes here and omit Manila. Commercial routes encircle Mindanao,
drawing from it copra and hemp, and supplying in return cotton cloth,
canned goods, rice, and other commercial staples. Smaller vessels
ply between the Bicol provinces, Masbate, Leyte, and Manila, carrying
hemp principally.


[Control over Rates]

The steamers of the Philippine Islands are not allowed to charge the
prices "the traffic will bear," without any recourse by shippers. The
Public Utility Commission fixes the maximum rates for all classes of
traffic and for all ports of the Islands. In this way the interests
of the producing and consuming public are protected, and destructive
rate wars between shipper and carrier and among the several companies
are avoided.

XII. STRUCTURE OF THE PHILIPPINE GOVERNMENT


[Patterned after American system]

The government of the Philippine Islands as it now exists and
functions resembles in structure the Federal and State governments of
the United States. It is reared on the same fundamental principles of
representative democracy which have made the United States government
the model for other states, so that the Philippine government is
just as much a republican government as that of the United States;
the will of the majority rules.

The law of public officers as observed in the United States is
in effect in the Philippine Islands. The principle of division of
powers is recognized, and the functions of government are distributed
among three departments, the executive, the legislative, and the
judicial. The principle of checks and balances is likewise observed,
and the legislature and the courts are prohibited from delegating
their powers. The passage of irrepealable laws is forbidden. The
government is immune from suit at the instance of private individuals
except with its consent.




DEPARTURES FROM AMERICAN STANDARDS.--There have been several
departures, however, from the American standard of government that have
been made by the Filipinos. For instance, the budget system has been
adopted previous to its adoption in the United States to provide for
economy and certainty in expenditures. The Council of State was created
as a coördinating and advisory body to the Governor-General. It is
made up of the Governor-General as presiding officer, the six members
of the cabinet, the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the
House of Representatives. It also serves to bring the executive and
the legislative departments into close relationship. The creation
of the council seems to indicate a tendency to adopt in the future
a parliamentary or semi-parliamentary system of government.

In addition to the foregoing departments there is the further
innovation conferring on either house of the legislature, the right to
call and interpellate the secretaries of departments before it. The
secretaries of departments in turn have the right to be heard in
the legislature. The chairmen of the appropriation committees are
also empowered to require the attendance of chiefs of bureaus and
offices, thus bringing the executive and legislative departments in
close harmony.


[Autonomy]

All of the officials of the government are Filipinos with the exception
of the Governor-General and the Vice-Governor-General and the majority
of the members of the Supreme Court who are Americans, appointed by the
President of the United States. There is thus a practical autonomy,
the American chief executive having supervision and control of the
government in theory but in actual practice rarely acting on matters
of domestic concern except with the advice of the Council of State.

Appointments made by the Governor-General are with the advice and
consent of the Philippine Senate.




THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL.--The Governor-General is appointed by the
President by and with the consent of the Senate and holds his office
at the pleasure of the President and until his successor is chosen
and qualified. Through the Secretary of War, he is responsible
to the President and the American people for his acts. He has a
more responsible position than that held by the Governors of the
several states of the union. He is paid a handsome salary from
the Philippine government and is given free quarters. As chief
executive of the Islands, he is in charge of the executive control
of the Philippine government; which he exercises either in person or
through the secretaries of departments. He can veto laws passed by
the Philippine Legislature.




THE VICE-GOVERNOR.--The Vice-Governor is also appointed by the
President of the United States with the consent of the Senate. He
acts at the same time as the Secretary of Public Instruction and may
be assigned such other executive duties as the Governor-General may
designate. In case of vacancy in the office of the Governor-General,
the Vice-Governor acts.




THE EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS.--There are six executive departments. At
the head of each is a department secretary, who, with the exception
of the Secretary of Public Instruction, must be a citizen of the
Philippine Islands. As Secretary he is assisted by an under-secretary
who temporarily performs the duties of department secretary in case
of vacancy. The executive departments and bureaus, offices, and boards
pertaining to each are given below:


    Governor-General:

        Bureau of Audits.
        Bureau of Civil Service.
        All other offices and branches of the service not assigned
          by law to any Department.

    Department of the Interior:
        Bureau of Non-Christian Tribes.
        Philippine General Hospital.
        Board of Pharmaceutical Examiners.
        Board of Medical Examiners.
        Board of Dental Examiners.
        Board of Optical Examiners.
        Board of Examiners for Nurses.
        Board of Dental Hygiene.
        Executive Bureau.
        Philippine Constabulary.
        Public Welfare Commissioner.

    Department of Public Instruction:

        Bureau of Education.
        Philippine Health Service.
        Bureau of Quarantine Service.

    Department of Finance:

        Bureau of Customs.
        Bureau of Internal Revenue.
        Bureau of the Treasury.
        Bureau of Printing.
        General supervision over banks, banking transactions, coinage,
          currency, and except as otherwise specially provided, over
          all funds the investments of which may be authorized by law.

    Department of Justice:

        Bureau of Justice.
        Courts of First Instance and Inferior Courts.
        Philippine Library and Museum.
        Bureau of Prisons.
        Public Utility Commission.

    Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources:

        Bureau of Agriculture.
        Bureau of Forestry.
        Bureau of Lands.
        Matters pertaining to colonies and plantations on public lands.
        Bureau of Science.
        Weather Bureau.
        Matters concerning hunting, fisheries, sponges, and other
          sea products.

    Department of Commerce and Communications:

        Bureau of Public Works.
        Bureau of Posts.
        Bureau of Supply.
        Bureau of Labor.
        Bureau of Coast and Geodetic Survey.
        Bureau of Commerce and Industry.


The Executive Bureau and the Bureau of Non-Christian Tribes, both of
which are under the Department of the Interior, exercise supervision
over the provincial and municipal governments. The Executive Bureau
has charge of the so-called regular provinces, and the Bureau of
Non-Christian Tribes of those inhabited by the backward inhabitants
of the Philippines including the Moros in Mindanao and the Igorotes
of the mountain regions of Luzon. The functions of these two bureaus
are practically identical, the difference lying only in the degree
of civilization of the inhabitants over whom they have supervision.




THE LEGISLATIVE DEPARTMENT.--The legislative branch of the Philippine
government is vested in the Philippine legislature. It is made
up of two separate coördinate bodies, the Senate and the House of
Representatives. All the senators and representatives are elected by
direct popular suffrage with the exception of the representatives and
senators from the Mountain Province, the Province of Nueva Vizcaya,
and the provinces in Mindanao and Sulu who are appointed by the
Governor-General with no restriction as to residence or length of
office. The elective representatives hold their office for terms of
three years and the senators for terms of six years.

Laws dealing with certain special subjects such as the tariff and the
mining laws require the approval of the President of the United States.

The Senate has twenty-four members consisting of two senators from
each of the twelve senatorial districts. The lower house has ninety
members, determined by the population of each province. Appropriation
bills originate by custom in the House of Representatives.




THE JUDICIARY.--An independent judiciary system completes the
governmental structure. The administration of justice is entrusted
to the Supreme Court, the Courts of First Instance, the Municipal
Court of the City of Manila, and the courts of justices of the peace
in each municipality.

The Supreme Court is the highest legal entity in the judiciary
system. It has an appellate jurisdiction in all actions and special
proceedings brought to it from the Courts of First Instance and from
other inferior tribunals from whose decision appeals to the Supreme
Court are allowed. The justices of the Supreme Court are appointed
by the President of the United States with the consent of the United
States Senate and serve during good behavior. It is made up of nine
justices, the chief justice and eight associate justices. The chief
justice has always been a Filipino. It seats in banc to transact
business. It also seats in divisions for the same purpose, and when
it so sits, four justices constitute a quorum so that two divisions
may sit at the same time.

Appeals to the Supreme Court of the United States are allowed in
certain cases only.

The judges of the Court of First Instance are appointed by the
Governor-General with the consent of the Philippine Senate and serve
practically for life, the only restriction being that they must retire
upon reaching sixty-five years of age. The justices of the peace are
also appointed by the Governor-General with the advice and consent
of the Philippine Senate.




PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT.--The Philippine Archipelago is divided into
46 provinces, 34 of which are designated as regular provinces and
the remaining 12 as special provinces.--The chief executive of a
regular province is the provincial governor, who is an elective
official. He, together with two other elective members, form the
provincial board which constitutes the legislative branch of the
provincial government. In the special provinces, with the exception of
Mindoro, Palawan, and Batanes, the provincial governors are appointive
officials.




MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT.--As the name indicates, this branch of the
Government has charge of the municipalities or towns. The chief
executive of a municipality is called the municipal president. The
municipal council, which is the legislative branch of the municipal
government, consists of from 8 to 18 councilors, depending on the
size of the municipality. There is a vice-president who substitutes
the president during his absence or disability and who is ex-officio
member of the council. All these officials are elected by the people.




EXPENSES OF THE PHILIPPINE GOVERNMENT.--All the expenses of the
Philippine government are paid for from the Insular Treasury. The
United States government pays for nothing in the administration of the
Islands except for the army and navy and the salaries of the resident
commissioners from the Philippines who are stationed in Washington
and granted the privileges of members of Congress.

An investigation into the expenses incurred by the United States for
the Philippine Islands, exclusive of the maintenance of her army and
navy, elicits the following facts:

1. That the Philippines has always been a self-supporting country;
all expenditures have been drawn from ordinary revenues.

2. That the sum of $267,663.26 pertaining to the former government of
Spain and seized by the United States, and therefore legally pertaining
to the latter country, was subsequently turned over into the general
fund of the insular government.

3. That the Congress of the United States appropriated the sum
of $3,000,000, known as the "Congressional Relief Fund," for the
purchase, distribution and sale of farm implements, farm or draft
animals, supplies and necessaries of life, extermination of pests,
relief for sufferers due to fire and other calamities, etc. This
amount has been, at different times, appropriated by the Philippine
Commission for the purposes above mentioned. The unexpended balance
from this fund was subsequently turned over into the general funds.

Aside, therefore, from the Spanish seized funds and the expenses
for the army and navy, the only amount expended by the United
States directly for the benefit of the Philippine Islands was the
Congressional Relief Fund. The Philippine government having always had,
at the end of every year, an excess of ordinary revenue over ordinary
expenditure, the United States could not have any other occasion to
give direct pecuniary aid for the maintenance of the Islands.


FINANCIAL STATUS.--The Philippine government today is on a solid
financial basis as any government in the world. It is self-supporting,
its taxation is adequate to its needs, the per capita tax of the
people is low. The Filipinos bear a smaller burden of taxation
than the natives of Great Britain, United States, Japan, Argentina,
and Brazil. The year, 1922, was presented with an aggregate surplus
of approximately $64,000,000 in central, provincial, and municipal
governments including the City of Manila. This goes to show that both
the central and local governments are on a sound financial basis.

A clearer comprehension of the financial standing of the government
may be had from an inspection of the following tables:

CURRENCY.--At the time of the American occupation, the Mexican dollar
and the Spanish peso were in circulation in the Islands as a part of
the currency. The Mexican dollar had been introduced because of the
trade between the Philippines and Mexico, which was fostered by the
Spanish galleons. Besides the Mexican dollar and the Spanish peso,
there also circulated the silver peso or dollar of the various South
American countries. For fractional currency, however, the Spanish
coins predominated. The denominations were half peso, peseta, and
media peseta. Gold pieces were of P1, P2, and P4 denominations.

The first mint in the Islands was installed during the reign of Isabela
II. It was then that the Philippine peso, both in gold and silver,
was first coined.


[Currency Legislation]

America early decided to make the currency system more stable
and scientific. On March 2, 1903, Congress passed the Philippine
Coinage Act which established the conant or Philippine peso as the
official coin of the Islands. The effect of this Act was to drive
away all the previous coins in circulation, and it is the basis of
the present currency system in the Philippine Islands. The coins
provided for were of the denomination of the peso, half-peso, peseta,
media peseta, 5 centavos, 1 centavo, and one-half centavo, while the
silver certificates were in the denominations of P2, P5, P10, P20, P50,
P100, P500. The peso was issued on the basis of two Philippine pesos
(P2) to one dollar ($1) gold, United States currency. To maintain the
parity the Gold Standard Act was passed by the Philippine Commission in
October, 1903. There are gold deposits in the banks of the United
States to guarantee every Philippine Government certificate in
circulation. This places the Philippines practically on an actual
gold basis.


[Notes]

The notes in circulation at the time the Americans came were those
issued by the Banco Español-Filipino. They were in 10, 25, 50,
100, and 200 Mexican denominations. After the introduction of the
Philippine peso, P1 notes were also allowed to circulate. In 1912,
this same Banco Español was allowed to change its name to that of
the Bank of the Philippine Islands, and thereafter, a new series of
notes were issued, having the same size as the certificates issued
by the Philippine Government, but of the denominations of P5, P10,
P20, P50, P100, and P200.

When the Philippine National Bank was established in 1916, it was
authorized to issue notes to be known as circulating notes. In
accordance with this authorization, denominations of P1, P2, P5,
and P10 began to appear.

The stability of the currency system in the Philippines depends
solely on the maintenance of the parity of the Philippine peso with
the gold dollar on the established basis of 2 to 1. This can be
easily accomplished by keeping always intact the gold deposits in
the United States.

ELECTORS.--The total number of electors registered in the election

which is a very fine percentage when compared to the interest in
elections shown in other countries. In the elections of 1912, 248,154
voters registered, of which 235,786 voted. Of the number of voters
registered in 1919, 407,346 possessed educational qualifications,
while only 81,916 were educationally qualified in 1912. It should
be noted that the Philippine voters must have either property or
educational qualifications, so that these figures show the progress
of the people in political matters and in education in general during
the last few years. In the elections of June, 1922, there were 824,058
voters registered.

The minority party has always accepted the decision of the majority,
unless it thinks that the election has been vitiated by some
illegal act, in which case it takes the matter up with the courts
for decision. The practice of revolutionary countries where defeated
minorities take the law in their own hands or use violence against
the triumphant party, or utilize every other means to hinder the
working of the government, has never been resorted to in the Islands.









XIII. THE FILIPINOS IN CONTROL


[Original Policy]

The Second Philippine Commission sent out to the Philippines by
President McKinley on March 16, 1900 were given the following
instruction, among others:


   "That in all cases, the municipal officers who administer the local
    affairs of the people are to be selected by the people and that
    wherever officers of more extended jurisdiction are to be selected
    in any way, natives of the Islands are to be preferred, and if
    they can be found competent and willing to perform their duties
    they are to receive the offices in preference to any others."


These instructions were confirmed by President Roosevelt when he
said that the Government of the Philippine Islands would cease to
be a government of Americans aided by Filipinos and instead would
be a government of Filipinos aided by Americans. And in 1908 after
the opening of the Philippine Assembly, President Roosevelt in his
message to Congress added:


   "I trust that within a generation the time will arrive when the
    Filipinos can decide for themselves whether it is well for them to
    become independent or continue under the protection of a strong
    and disinterested power, able to guarantee to the islands order
    at home and protection from foreign invasion."


[Filipinization]

In pursuance of all this policy the placing of Filipinos in government
offices was hastened from 1913 to 1921, the turning over of power into
Filipino hands having been virtually made complete by the passage
of the Jones Law in 1916. This law provided for the creation of an
elective Senate and House of Representatives and for the appointment
of heads of departments and other government officials. Appointments
made by the Governor-General were made to be with the advice and
consent of the Philippine Senate.

The proportion of Filipinos to Americans in the Philippine Government
during the period 1914-1921 is shown in the following table:


    -----+--------------------------------+-----------------------
         |           Number               |      Percentage
    -----+-----------+-----------+--------+-----------+-----------
    Year | Americans | Filipinos |  Total | Americans | Filipinos

    1914 |   2,148   |   7,283   |  9,451 |    23     |     77
    1915 |   1,935   |   7,881   |  9,816 |    20     |     80

    -----+-----------+-----------+--------+-----------+-----------


[Instruments of Autonomy]

The principal agencies that gave the Filipinos effective control
over domestic affairs in conformity with the spirit of the Jones Law,
were the following:

1. The creation of a Council of State on October 16, 1918, to help
and advise the Governor-General on matters of public importance. In
this council many prominent leaders of the Filipino people have
figured prominently.

2. The creation of the Philippine Cabinet by which the Government
Departments were organized and the work of the Executive Department
divided among them. The aim was to have them undertake the work
expressly entrusted to them, and to have in each branch of the
administration a head responsible for its policy and direction. Each
Secretary of Department assumes responsibility for all the activities
of the government under his control and supervision. To this end he
has the power to initiate, the power to regulate, the power to direct
and inspect, and the power to appoint and remove.

3. The several laws that had given to the Council of State and to the
Chairmen of the two houses of the Legislature the power to supervise
and control the execution of the laws.

4. The liberal policy followed by Governor-General Harrison in
accordance with the liberal tenor of the Jones Law, a policy really
preparatory for the independence of the Philippines.

Speaking of this policy, Governor-General Harrison on September 1,
1916, said:


   "I firmly believe that the Chief Executive should consult the
    people through their representatives who are called upon to serve
    them. This is the very life-blood of self-government. It should
    never be possible for a Chief Executive--and it will now never
    be possible here--to ride ruthlessly over the people he has been
    sent here to govern, without taking into account their feelings,
    and without due consideration to their desires."




ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE FILIPINO GOVERNMENT.--The outstanding achievements
of the Filipinized government are summarized below.




I. REORGANIZATION OF DEPARTMENTS.--The Reorganization Act, as finally
passed by the Philippine Legislature (Act No. 2666 as amended by
Act No. 2803), has provided the Philippine government with a more
logical and scientific grouping of bureaus and offices. It has given
the new department heads more authority and power over the offices
and bureaus under them. They are now empowered to promulgate rules,
regulations, orders, circulars, memorandums, and other instructions
for the harmonious and efficient administration of each and all of the
offices and dependencies of each department. Secretaries of departments
may be called by either of the two Houses of the Legislature for the
purpose of reporting on matters pertaining to their departments. In
this case they are also responsible to the two Houses. The six
departments created by the Reorganization Act correspond to the six
principal purposes of a fairly well organized government, to wit:


[Functions of the Departments]

(1) The maintenance of order and political direction of local
administrative units, such as departments, provincial and municipal
governments, and special governments--the Department of Interior;

(2) The guardianship of the State over the mental development and
physical welfare of the citizens--the Department of Public Instruction;

(3) The collection of the public revenues and administration of the
finances and business of the government--the Department of Finance;

(4) The enforcement of the law and safeguarding of the citizens and
their rights--the Department of Justice;

(5) The guardianship in connection with the preservation of the
natural resources and the development of the country's sources of
wealth--the Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources; and

(6) The carrying out of such work and services as cannot be performed
by private citizens, conducive to the common welfare and public
prosperity--the Department of Commerce and Communications.




II. ADOPTION OF A BUDGETARY SYSTEM.--A scientific budgetary system
has been adopted. Under the system the estimates are made under the
supervision and control of the department heads who have the power to
add or cut down items. These different estimates are then submitted to
the Secretary of Finance, who coördinates them. Any conflict between
a departmental head and the Secretary of Finance is submitted to the
Council of State for decision. Once the budget is definitely approved
by the Council of State the Governor-General submits it with a message
to the Legislature.

The lower house is the first one to take up the budget. The
corresponding Department Secretary appears before it to explain the
details of the budget for his Department and to answer all questions
by the members. Once the budget is approved in principle it is sent
to the Committee on Appropriations with instructions to draft the
appropriation bill in accordance therewith. When the appropriation
bill is approved by the house, it is sent to the Senate and practically
the same procedure is followed.


[The Emergency Board]

To make the budgetary system sufficiently elastic to meet changing
conditions, there has been created the so-called Emergency Board
composed of the Secretary of Finance as Chairman, two members of
the Legislature, the Insular Auditor and the Attorney-General as
members. In the general Appropriation Act, this board is given a
substantial amount with which to supply the additional funds that the
various units of the government may need for the purpose authorized
by the appropriation law. As an additional safe-guard, the actions
of the Emergency Board do not become operative until after approval
by the Governor-General and the presidents of both houses.




III. PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS.--In public improvements, the following was
the record of the Filipinos within the last nine years. The mileage
of first-class roads was more than doubled increasing from 2,172
kilometers in 1913 to 4,782 in 1922, not to speak of the second
and third class; 7,562 permanent bridges and culverts are now in
existence; 725 permanent government buildings were built, including
schools, public markets, hospitals, provincial capitols, and large
and beautiful edifices for the university and the Insular government;
a network of wireless stations was erected throughout the provinces;
a vast program of improvements in port works was launched, and a bond
issue of ten million pesos was sold in the United States for harbor
improvements in Manila alone; irrigation works estimated to cost about
ten million pesos, and designed to benefit 150,000 acres of land in
sixteen different localities, were initiated; 949 artesian wells in
the different provinces, an average of one to each municipality, were
drilled at a total cost of nearly two and one-half million pesos,
and 55 new water-works systems were installed with 36 more under
active construction, to cost more than three million pesos.




IV. AGRICULTURE AND TAXATION.--The progress in agriculture was
remarkable. The chief point of interest here is that the placing of
Filipinos in control of the agricultural departments greatly enlarged
the power of the Government to influence the people to increased
production. Of rice alone, 1,285,385 acres more were planted during
the last nine years (1913-1922); 544 rural-credit societies were
established with a membership of 75,114 and coöperation in agriculture,
a new spirit among the farmers, encouraged and explained.

Taxation was revised and increased, and the government revenue
from this source which in 1913 had been only P39,236,007, rose to
P62,900,403 in 1919 and P64,259,776 in 1922; there are twelve banking
institutions in the Islands, now, instead of only six, and the money
in circulation has risen from P50,000,000 in 1914 to three times
that figure.




V. PUBLIC ORDER.--Public order, the first requisite of a stable
government, has been splendidly maintained through the agency of the
Philippine Constabulary and the municipal police. The Constabulary
has always been dependable and thoroughly efficient. There is hardly
any country in the world more peaceful than the Philippines.




VI. EDUCATION.--The present school system in the Philippines has been
one of the principal uplifting agencies in the colonial enterprise
undertaken by the United States as a result of the Spanish-American
war. Immediately after the capitulation of Manila, an army officer
acting as superintendent of schools opened schools. Everywhere the army
went afterwards a public school was established and put into operation.

The school system is supported entirely from Philippine revenue. The
advance has been rapid, there now being about a million pupils in
the schools being taken care of by the Philippine government. The
attendance of almost a million is entirely voluntary, there being no
compulsory education law.

The public school system has received the unstinted support of the
Filipino people. The first bill passed by the Philippine Assembly in
1907 was the appropriation of one million pesos for the building of
rural schools. In 1918 the thirty million-peso act was passed, which
provided that thirty million pesos be set aside, over and above the
regular annual appropriation, for school-housing and equipment. The
law is expected to provide school facilities for every boy and girl
of school age in the Islands by 1924.

The head of the public-school system is the Vice-Governor-General who
is at the same time Secretary of Public Instruction. The executive
control is centered in the Bureau of Education headed by a director,
who is responsible for the conduct of public schools and has the
authority necessary to make his control effective.


School divisions.--The Islands are divided into forty-nine school
divisions, each division generally coinciding with the boundaries of
a province, except the City of Manila, and four Insular schools--the
Philippine Normal School, the Philippine School of Arts and Trades,
the Philippine Nautical School, and the Central Luzon Agricultural
School--each of which is considered as a distinct division. A
division is under the immediate charge of a superintendent who
is the representative of the Director of Education. The Division
Superintendent in the province is generally assisted by a provincial
industrial supervisor and an academic supervisor. Each provincial
division is divided into different districts consisting of one or
more municipalities and several barrios or villages, each under the
charge of a supervising teacher.

There are 50 provincial high schools. There are 20 provincial
trade schools and 14 provincial shops, the principals of which are
responsible directly either to the principal of the provincial school
or to the Division Superintendent of Schools.

The original feature of all school work was the academic. Soon the
Bureau of Education labored to make industrial work a part and parcel
of the curriculum. This was followed by making physical education a
vital part of the courses. And now the aim is to maintain a proper
balance in the academic, industrial, physical, and social work.

The English language is the only medium of instruction.

There are seven elementary grades--four primary and three
intermediate. The secondary courses take four years. There has been
built up an English-speaking Filipino teaching staff--a distinctive
achievement reflecting credit on Filipinos and Americans alike.


Vocational instruction.--Graded vocational instruction occupies an
important place in the school curricula. Approximately 14 per cent
of the total time in the primary grades and about 17 per cent of the
total time in the general intermediate course is devoted to this form
of instruction. The special intermediate vocational courses include
farming and trades for boys and housekeeping and household arts
for girls. The chief aims of industrial instruction are: first,
industrial intelligence; second, industrial skill; and, third,
industrial sympathy. The educational and economic values of industrial
education are kept in view. It may be of interest to mention that the
Bureau of Education annually receives orders amounting to $150,000 a
year from various firms abroad, especially from America, for handicraft
articles; that trade school production yearly is over $100,000 and that
the yearly agricultural production of the schools is over $281,000.

Agricultural education.--The Philippines being essentially an
agricultural country, agricultural education is given considerable
attention. The Bureau of Education at present maintains 13 large
agricultural schools, 15 farm schools, and 162 settlement farm
schools. The agricultural school range in area from about 125 to
about 3,000 acres; the farm schools, from about 40 to 125 acres;
the settlement farm schools, from about 30 to about 100 acres. In
addition to these, the Bureau of Education has an extensive program
of school and home gardening and maintains numerous agricultural clubs
for boys and girls. Under the stress of the world-wide economic crisis
brought about by the World War, the general office appealed to the
country for increased productions, and in response to this appeal,
the schools now have over 4,000 school gardens and over 100,000 home
gardens. Annually there are held over 20,000 Garden Days where there
are over 143,000 pupils' exhibits and about 40,000 farmers' exhibits.


Athletics.--The system of physical education here compares favorably
with the best in the world. The temptation of developing only a
few "stars" has been valiantly resisted and the athletic slogan of
"Athletics for Everybody" has been stressed instead. As a result of
this policy over 96 per cent of the pupils enrolled in the elementary
and secondary schools take active participation in the program of
athletics and games during the year.


Primary and Secondary Curriculum.--In the seven years' course the
studies are principally language, reading, good manners and right
conduct, arithmetic, civics, hygiene and sanitation, writing, drawing,
music, and Philippine history and government, in addition to a definite
vocational training and organized play and athletics. Besides the
regular secondary course, specialized secondary courses such as
the normal, commercial, trade, agricultural, and domestic science
are offered.

Number of pupils.--The enrollment of pupils in the public schools below
the University of the Philippines from the school year 1913-1914 to
1920-1921 is as follows:


            -----------+-----------+-------------------

            1917-1918  |   671,398 |   4,699 |     .7
            1918-1919  |   681,588 |  10,290 |    1.5
            1919-1920  |   791,626 | 110,040 |   16.0
            1920-1921. |   943,364 | 151,736 |   19.0
            1921-1922. | 1,077,342 | 133,978 |   13.0
            -----------+-----------+---------+---------


Number of schools and teachers.--The number of schools rose from 2,934
in 1913 to 7,670 in March, 1922, representing an increase of 128 per
cent. The average annual decrease in the number of schools from 1909
to 1913 (5 years preceding Filipino autonomy) was 181, or 4.8 per cent,
while the average yearly increase from 1914 to 1920 was 416.

The number of Filipino teachers increased from 7,671 in 1913 to 24,017
in 1922, which means an increase of 16,346, or 213 per cent. The
number of American teachers dropped from 658 in March, 1913, to 347
in March, 1922.


Number of school buildings.--The number of permanent school buildings
constructed up to 1913 was 624, which number rose to 1,301. In other
words, during nine years (1913-1922), 108 per cent more permanent
buildings were erected.


Universities.--Foremost among the universities in the Islands
is the University of the Philippines, which corresponds to a
state university. It gives courses in liberal arts, the sciences,
education, medicine and surgery, dentistry, pharmacy, agriculture,
veterinary medicine, engineering, law, forestry, music, and the
fine arts. Collegiate degrees are conferred upon graduates in all
the courses mentioned with the exception of the last two, for which
diplomas of proficiency are issued to the graduates.

The enrollment in the University for the school year 1922-1923 is
4,839, so that in 10 years the attendance rose from 1,400 in 1911-1912
to 4,839 in 1922-1923, representing an increase of 237 per cent. The
University has now 45 buildings of permanent materials.

The Santo Tomas University was the first to be established. It has the
distinction of being the oldest university under the American flag,
having been founded a quarter of a century before Harvard. It gives
courses in law, medicine, pharmacy, civil engineering, philosophy
and letters, and theology, and has about 700 students. The medium of
instruction is the Spanish language.

Besides these two universities there is the National University
with upwards of 4,500 students and the Manila University with almost
3,000. The presidents of the last two universities are Filipinos.

The overwhelming majority of the faculty in all the institutions of
high learning in the Islands are Filipinos.




VII. SANITATION.--In sanitation the progress attained by the
Philippines during the Filipinized government has also been rapid. The
sanitary work is now controlled by a central bureau called the
Philippine Health Service. With this centralization of activities
health measures can be enforced more economically and more effectively
than in previous years.

The municipalities are grouped into sanitary divisions, each of which
is in charge of a competent official. With few exceptions the men
in charge are qualified physicians. At the end of the year 1921,
there were 307 sanitary divisions comprising 792 out of the 846
municipalities. In other words, nearly 94 per cent of the total
number of municipalities in the Philippines form a part of these
sanitary divisions.

Some of the important functions of the Philippine Health Service are
as follows:

1. Control and supervision of all hospitals for dangerous communicable
diseases, and the isolation of persons suffering from such diseases.

2. Control of sanitation of schoolhouses and premises, prisons and
all other places for the detention of prisoners.

3. Establishment and maintenance of internal quarantine in times of
epidemic and the systematic inoculation of the inhabitants with virus,
sera, and prophylactics.

                     France.                 17.70




VIII. LOCAL AUTONOMY.--Greater autonomy has been extended to the
provinces and municipalities especially as regards local taxes,
education, sanitation, and permanent public improvements.

One of the significant and substantial results of the new policy
is the remarkable improvement in the finances of the provinces and
municipalities. During the period 1914 to 1920 a general revision of
assessment of real properties was conducted in all the provinces. From
this assessment we find an increase of 1,703,449 in the number of lots
of taxable real property on December 31, 1920, as compared with the
corresponding figure on September 30, 1913, representing an increase of
about 100 per cent. The increase, of course, means increased revenue
from the real property taxes for the local government.

A study of the revenues of the provinces and municipalities during 1914
to 1920, as compared with the period 1909 to 1913, shows an increase
of 1,090 per cent, the average percentage of yearly increase being
155.5 per cent. In 1922 the revenues of the provinces were P19,264,264;
those of the municipalities were P32,486,068.




IX. PUBLIC WELFARE.--One of the first acts of the Philippine government
since control was turned over into the hands of Filipinos was the
creation of the so-called Public Welfare Board entrusted with the task
of coördinating the work of private and public welfare agencies. The
board acts as the agency for controlling the disbursement of public
charity funds to semi-public institutions like the Anti-tuberculosis
Society, the Gota de Leche, and the Women's Clubs.

On February 23, 1916, an act was passed by the Legislature
appropriating P1,000,000 for the protection of early infancy and the
establishment of branches of the "Gota de Leche." Local organizations
were granted aid from this funds as much as what they raised.

In 1917 the government established an orphanage for destitute and
dependent children from all over the islands, managed according to
the most modern methods.


[Public Welfare Commissioner]

On February 18, 1918, the public welfare board membership was reduced
to five and its administrative control placed under the Department
of the Interior. The administration of the million-peso funds for
the protection of early infancy and the establishment of maternity
and child-welfare centers were also placed under the control of the
Secretary of the Interior on March 22, 1920. Later these activities
were all grouped together by Act 2988, enacted February 24, 1921,
into one office--the office of the public welfare commissioner--which
started operation on May 1, 1921.

The aim of the office is summarized thus: To promote all work directed
towards the early reduction of infant mortality in the Philippines
by employing adequate means for this purpose and for carrying out
other activities intended to bring about the general welfare of the
community, especially that which concerns children.

A central executive office is maintained in Manila. It investigates
social conditions and compiles sociological information for
distribution. Social centers are being established throughout the
Islands. On December, 1922, 183 puericulture centers were in existence
as against 80 on December, 1921.


X. ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE.--The Supreme Court of the Philippine
Islands presided over by a Filipino has always enjoyed the respect
and confidence of every citizen. It is above all influence, being
composed of men of integrity and of exceptional talent.

The Courts of First Instance have also a comparatively good record
as is evident from the number of decisions affirmed, reversed, and
modified by the Supreme Court. The figures are as follows:


-----------------+-------+--------------+-------------+-------------
                 |       |   Affirmed   |   Reversed  |  Modified
    Period       |Total  +-------+------+------+------+------+------
                 |number | Number| Per  |Number| Per  |Number| Per
                 |       |       | cent |      | cent |      | cent
-----------------+-------+-------+------+------+------+------+------
August 31, 1911  |       |       |      |      |      |      |
  to September,  |       |       |      |      |      |      |
  1, 1913.       | 1,454 |  910  | 62.5 |  365 | 25.1 |  179 | 12.2
                 |       |       |      |      |      |      |
March 3, 1919 to |       |       |      |      |      |      |
  March 4, 1921. | 1,782 | 1,194 | 67.0 |  372 | 20.8 |  216 | 12.1
-----------------+-------+-------+------+------+------+------+------


The foregoing figures indicate that there was a larger percentage of
decisions affirmed and smaller percentage of decisions reversed by
the Supreme Court during the time when the Filipino people were given
substantial autonomy proving that the administration of justice has
been considerably improved with the Filipinos in control.

In 1913 there were 12,000 pending cases disposed of; in 1921 the
number rose to 16,874; in 1922, 20,632.

From 1907 to 1913, for a period of seven years before Filipino
autonomy, the average yearly number of decrees of titles to land
issued by the Philippine courts was only 1,935; while from 1914 to
1920, during seven years of Filipino self-government, the average
yearly number of land titles settled was 12,396, six times more than
the preceding period.




XI. GOVERNMENT ENTERPRISES.--In order to hasten the economic progress
of the Islands, the Philippine government has been compelled to
organize and engage in certain business enterprises of national
importance that private initiative and capital have so far failed to
develop. There are now four of these government owned enterprises--the
Philippine National Bank, the Manila Railroad, the National Coal
Company, and the National Development Company. The underlying motives
behind these ventures are:

(1) To conserve the resources of the Islands for Filipinos; (2) to
protect the people against exploitation; (3) to safeguard against
profiteering; (4) to facilitate the extension of credit to private
concerns.


The Philippine National Bank.--The need for a national bank in the
Islands has long been felt. Previous to its establishment, Filipino
farmers and merchants had to go to foreign banks in order to secure
the necessary capital. The Philippine government had also to deposit
its money with foreign banking institutions which gave a very low
rate of interest. All the foreign banks made very little investments
in the Islands, preferring to deal almost exclusively with export
and import trade.

To remedy these conditions the Philippine National Bank was
organized. From a modest beginning the bank grew by leaps and bounds,
especially during the war.


[Constructive Service]

In spite of the many criticisms hurled against it, the constructive
service that the bank has rendered to the community stands out in
bold relief--the financing of the liberty loans, the handling of
the sale of alien property, the financial assistance extended in
time of dire need to two banks doing business in the islands, the
financing of sugar centrals, the giving of loans to agriculturists,
and the extension of banking facilities to merchants and manufacturers.

The post-war depression caught the bank unprepared to meet the
emergencies and it suffered heavy losses. The bank, however, is now
in a fair way to sound footing. But as an institution, despite its
reverses, it has come to be part and parcel of Philippine financial
life. The Filipino people regard the bank as indispensable in the
economic development of the islands.


The Manila Railroad.--The Philippine railroads were taken over
by the government in 1916. They were bought from an old English
company. The principal motive that impelled the purchase of the lines
from the English owners was the failure of the owners to operate
the lines with profit. This failure resulted in the imposition of
greater burden on the taxpayers in the way of payment for interest
on railroad bonds guaranteed by the government from the early days
of American administration. The secondary motive was of course to
nationalize this most important medium of communication and to put
it at government disposal in case of emergency.

From 1914 to 1916 the aggregate net deficit of the company was about
$600,000. Under government management the railroad has been gaining
steadily. In 1917 the gain was $400,000; in 1918, $130,000; in 1920,
$120,000; and in 1921 $148,000, with the added advantage that the
government has not been called upon to pay any interest on the bonds.


The National Coal Company.--During the war the coal shortage was one
of the great problems that the government had to solve. The Philippine
Islands are rich in coal deposits, but very little private capital
has been invested in its exploitation. The Philippine Legislature,
therefore, chartered the National Coal Company and supplied it with
a capital of $1,700,000. The company is now ready to furnish at least
the coal needed by the government, which is about 120,000 tons a year,
heretofore imported from foreign countries.


The National Development Company.--The company was organized for the
purpose of financing isolated commercial, industrial or agricultural
enterprises that the government may desire to establish for the general
welfare of the country, the motive being that whenever or wherever
there was profiteering the government should enter into competition
with the profiteer and compel him to reduce the cost of his goods.

The stock of the company is controlled, as in other government
companies, by a committee of three, composed of the Governor-General,
the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of
Representatives.

Other development companies which have been established by law, some of
which have not yet begun to function, are the National Cement Company
(2855), the National Coal Company (2705), the National Iron Company
(2862), and the National Petroleum Company (2814).









XIV. THE INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT


The sporadic but persistent agitation for reform which ultimately
evolved into the organized movement for independence since 1892,
began soon after the discovery of the Islands. In the beginning,
dissatisfaction manifested itself in more or less unimportant and
localized uprisings against the oppressive measures which the Spanish
rulers sought to impose upon the inhabitants.

Some of these uprisings, in outline form, were the following:


[Uprisings against Spain]

1574.--The first governor in Manila ordered the residents to supply his
troops food, and took two of the leading Filipinos as hostages. After a
time the Filipinos refused to submit any longer to the imposition. The
governor ordered the hostages to be shot. The Filipinos revolted.

1585.--The Province of Pampanga was a center of revolts.

1588.--A conspiracy against Legaspi and against the principal officials
of the city. The idea in this revolt was to expel the Spaniards from
the Philippine Islands.

1589.--Popular revolt in the Provinces of Cagayan and Ilocos Norte.

1622.--Like Pampanga, Bohol became a center of revolts. This year
saw a strange revolt which had a religious cause but later gained
national importance. It also developed leadership in the person of
one Tamblot. He was executed but his memory lived to inspire another
rebellion.

This same year saw an uprising in the Province of Leyte.

1643.--Ladia led a revolt in Bulacan. His plan was easily discovered
and he was put to death.

1645.--An uprising against the tax system in the Province of Pampanga,
the second revolt in that province.

1649.--The most widespread revolt the Spanish government had yet
seen against the system of conscripting labor whenever a Spaniard
needed it. Starting in Leyte the uprising spread from one province
to another and would not have been suppressed had not the governor
incited Filipinos against Filipinos.

1660.--Miniago led a rebellion in Pampanga against the system of
forced labor. At this time the Filipinos had already learned the
Spanish way of making promises which were never fulfilled, thus
instilling hatred in the Filipinos.

This same year witnessed another revolt in Pangasinan following the
Miniago revolt. The leader by the name of Malong gave the Spanish
government an almost unbearable trouble. He proclaimed his province,
Pangasinan, independent and started to set up a government of its
own. His army swept everything before it, but at last suffered defeat
by the hands of Spaniards. The Filipinos were gradually developing
military men, and at this time, one General Pedro Gumapus had been
recognized. He was arrested, however, and put to death with many of
his comrades.

1661.--A revolt in Ilocos, an aftermath of the Malong rebellion.

1686.--A conspiracy in Manila, but soon suppressed.

1719.--The riot in which Governor Bustamante and his son were
killed. This was the result of the long discord between the government
and the church.

1744.--Another rebellion in Bohol. This time the leader was Dagohoy
and under his leadership his army was able to drive the Spanish troops
away. Dagohoy set up a government in Bohol.

1762.--Pangasinan revolted again, but again unsuccessful.

1762.--A revolt occurred during the war with Great Britain. Silan
offered his services to raise troops against the British. In reply
the government sent him to prison for a spy. The Filipinos revolted
and broke jail, letting the prisoner out. Silan was later murdered
by an assassin whom the Spaniards hired. His widow who continued the
revolt was arrested and hanged.

1762.--The Provinces of Cagayan, Laguna, and Batangas revolted against
the tax system.

1785.--Nueva Ecija revolted.

1807.--A rebellion in Ilocos in which the Filipinos demanded
constitutional rights. The rebels captured the town of Piddig and
overcame the Spanish forces.

1811.--The Igorots plotted to annihilate all the Spaniards. The plan
was betrayed to the authorities and was nipped in the bud.

1812.--For the first time in the history of Spain the demand for
reforms was met with constitutional concession. The Filipinos were
to have representation in the Cortes of Spain. The constitution
was later discarded by King Ferdinand VII and upon hearing this the
Filipinos revolted.

1814.--A rebellion against the oppressive tax system.

1820.--An uprising during a cholera epidemic, as the people believed
that the government had been neglecting its duty. It was quelled,
and a frightful massacre followed.

1823.--A mutiny at Novales led by a mestizo army officer.

1827.--This year the rebels of Bohol were temporarily subjugated
after an independence of about eight years.

1840.--An extensive revolt in southern Luzon led by Apolinario de
la Cruz, a student in theology. Cruz organized a Brotherhood of San
Juan and asked for the coöperation of the church. In reply, De la
Cruz was arrested for working seditiously. Revolt followed in which
the leader was arrested and shot.

1843.--An uprising in Manila as a resentment against the treatment
of De la Cruz.

1872.--This revolt was different from any other previous revolt as it
was no longer a protest against specific injustice but a revolt based
upon idealistic basis. The leaders came from the educated class. The
victims included such harmless men as Father Burgos, Father Zamora,
and Father Gomez who were executed.

1883, 1888.--These years saw various revolts against oppressive
treatments.

1892.--This year marked the beginning of the long and constructive
struggle which changed the history of the Filipino people. It was
characterized by a systematic campaign for freedom, culminating in
the execution of Jose Rizal and the successful Revolution of 1896.




THE ORGANIZED MOVEMENT.--The leadership and the national ideals which
these uprisings developed, became apparent in the Revolution of 1896
when the masses rose in arms against Spain and demanded separation
and freedom. General MacArthur said of this Revolution:


   "When I first started in against these rebels, I believed that
    Aguinaldo's troops represented only a faction. I did not like to
    believe that the whole population of Luzon--the native population,
    that is--were opposed to us and our offers of good government. But
    after having come this far, after having occupied several towns and
    cities in succession, and having been brought much in contact with
    both insurrectos and amigos, I have been reluctantly compelled
    to believe that the Filipino masses were loyal and devoted to
    Aguinaldo and the government which he heads."


Upon the cessation of hostilities and after the organization of
the civil government in the Islands under the American régime, the
Philippine Commission passed an act which virtually prohibited all
agitations for Philippine independence. Under these circumstances, the
movement had to go on in an unorganized manner against the opposition
of the Federal Party which indorsed annexation of the Philippines
to the United States. The party, however, never had any substantial
support, and soon lost the little it had. Another party had appeared
on the scene, having immediate independence for its slogan and the
multitude rallied around its standard.

As an organized and systematic movement, the agitation began with
the institution of the Philippine Assembly in 1907. The Philippine
Assembly was then the popular branch of the Philippine Legislature,
the upper house being the Commission of which the majority were
Americans. The issue in the general elections was independence for
the Islands, and the Nacionalista Party, which championed the cause,
gained an overwhelming majority in the Assembly over the Federal
Party. At the close of the first session of this representative body,
the Speaker, Hon. Sergio Osmeña, declared:


   "Permit me, gentlemen of the chamber, to declare solemnly before
    God and before the world, upon my conscience as a deputy and
    representative of my compatriots, and under my responsibility
    as president of this chamber, that we believe the people desire
    independence, and that we believe ourselves capable of leading
    an orderly existence, efficient both in internal and external
    affairs, as a member of the free and civilized nations."


The cause of Philippine independence has been paramount in Philippine
affairs since then, but the Filipino people have been striving for
that national objective in the most peaceful manner. After the war
the movement was resumed, and since 1919 two delegations have been
sent to the United States to present pleas for independence to the
President and Congress. The first went in 1919, the second in 1921.




AMERICA'S POLICY AND PROMISE TO THE FILIPINO PEOPLE.--The plea for
freedom is based on two contentions. First, that it is the right of
all nations to be free; second, that independence has been promised
by the United States. Both of which premises are admitted. The only
question is when independence will be granted.

The Filipino people are one in their appeal for independence. All
political parties have this as a common objective. There is not one
discordant note in the age-long desire. The people are willing to
stake their all--take all the chances attendant upon an independent
existence. They want their freedom now.

On the other hand, America's policy toward the Islands has been
consistent. The pronouncements of her executive officials as well as
Congressional legislations all point to one conclusion: It has never
been the intention to make of the Philippines a perpetual possession;
independence is to be granted as soon as a stable government "can
be established."

PRONOUNCEMENTS OF AMERICAN PRESIDENTS.--In January 30, 1899, eight
months after the battle of Manila Bay, President McKinley dispatched
the First Philippine Commission to the Islands with the assurance
that the Commission would bring "the richest blessings of a liberating
rather than a conquering nation." Later on he added: "The Philippines
are ours, not to exploit but to develop, to civilize, to educate,
to train in the science of self-government."

In 1903 Mr. Taft, as Civil Governor of the Philippine Islands,
eloquently expressed himself thus:


   "From the beginning to the end, the state papers which were
    circulated in these Islands as authoritative expressions of the
    Executive had for their motto that 'the Philippines are for the
    Filipinos,' and that the government of the United States are here
    for the purpose of preserving the 'Philippines for the Filipinos'
    for their benefit, for their elevation, for their civilization,
    again and again appears."


And again, in 1907, he said:


   "The policy looks to the improvement of the people, both
    industrially and in self-governing capacity. As the policy
    of extending control continues, it must logically reduce and
    finally end the sovereignty of the United States in the Islands,
    unless it shall deem wise to the American and Filipino peoples,
    on account of mutually beneficial trade relations and possible
    advantages to the Islands in their foreign relations, that the
    bond shall not be completely severed."


In his message in 1908 President Roosevelt said:


   "I trust that within a generation the time will arrive when the
    Filipinos can decide for themselves whether it is well for them
    to become independent or to continue under protection of a strong
    and disinterested power, able to guarantee to the Islands order
    at home and protection from foreign invasion."


And in his autobiography Mr. Roosevelt remarked:


   "As regards the Philippines my belief was that we should train
    them for self-government as rapidly as possible and leave them
    free to decide their own fate."


On October 6, 1913, President Wilson, in a message for the Filipino
people, formulated America's policy thus:


   "We regard ourselves as trustees not for the advantage of
    the United States, but for the benefit of the people of the
    Philippine Islands. Every step we take will be taken with a view
    to ultimate independence of the Islands and as a preparation for
    that independence."


THE JONES LAW.--All these official declarations at last found
Congressional sanction and expression in the Jones Law passed in 1916
which in the opinion of the author, Congressman William Atkinson Jones,
is "the everlasting covenant of a great and generous people speaking
through their accredited representatives that they (the Filipinos)
shall in due time enjoy the incomparable blessings of liberty and
freedom." The preamble of the Law reads:


   "Whereas it was never the intention of the people of the United
    States in the incipiency of the War with Spain to make it a war
    of conquest or territorial aggrandizement; and

   "Whereas it is, as it has always been, the purpose of the people
    of the United States to withdraw their sovereignty over the
    Philippine Islands and to recognize their independence as soon
    as a stable government can be established therein; and

   "Whereas, for the speedy accomplishment of the purpose, it is
    desirable to place in the hands of the people of the Philippines
    as large a control of their domestic affairs as can be given them
    without in the meantime impairing the exercise of the right of
    sovereignty by the people of the United States in order that by
    the use and exercise of popular franchise and government powers
    they may be better prepared to fully assume the responsibilities
    and enjoy all the privileges of complete independence;

   "Therefore...."


This law is the first formal pronouncement of the American people,
through their accredited representatives, on the purpose of the United
States as regards the Philippine Islands. It is the formal pledge
that Independence will be granted. The only condition required is
that a stable government be first established in the Islands.

Executive recommendation for the fulfillment of America's
promise.--That there is now such a stable government in the Islands
is the claim of the Filipinos, and America is being asked to perform
her part of the covenant. In this claim of theirs, the Filipinos
are supported by the official representatives of the American people
themselves.

In his last message to Congress, December 2, 1920, President Wilson
made this recommendation:


   "Allow me to call your attention to the fact that the people of
    the Philippine Islands have succeeded in maintaining a stable
    government since the last action of the Congress in their behalf,
    and have thus fulfilled the condition set by the Congress as
    precedent to a consideration of granting independence to the
    Islands.

   "I respectfully submit that this condition having been fulfilled,
    it is our liberty and our duty to keep our promise to the people
    of those islands by granting them the independence which they so
    honorably covet."


Governor-General Harrison also testified before the Joint Committee of
Congress in 1919 that a stable government had already been established
in the Philippine Islands, to wit, "a government elected by the
suffrages of the people, which is supported by the people, which
is capable of maintaining order and of fulfilling its international
obligations."




MISSIONS TO UNITED STATES.--Soon after the termination of the world
war, it was decided to push the campaign for freedom with greater
vigor than ever before.

There was need, besides, of centralizing the campaign if it was to be
more effective. Accordingly, the Philippine Legislature, on November 1,
1918, created a "Commission of Independence," composed of the presiding
officers and members of both houses of the Legislature. The Commission
was for the purpose of considering and reporting to the Legislature:

(a) Ways and means of negotiating immediately for the granting and
recognition of the Independence of the Philippines.

(b) External guarantees of the stability and permanence of said
independence as well as of territorial integrity.

(c) Ways and means of organizing in a speedy, effectual and orderly
manner a constitutional and democratic internal government.


The First Mission.--One of the first actions of the Commission was
to recommend the sending of a special mission to the United States
to present the plea for freedom in a formal manner. The Legislature
approved this recommendation, and in May, 1919, a delegation arrived
at Washington, composed of forty prominent Filipinos representing the
two houses of the Legislature as well as the commercial, industrial,
agricultural, and labor interests of the Islands.

About the time it sailed, the Legislature adopted a "Declaration of
Purposes" for the guidance of the Commission of Independence and the
Philippine Mission. This declaration recited, among other things:


Declaration of Purposes.--* * * "In applying the principles enunciated
in documents and utterances on the Philippines to the conditions now
existing in the Islands, the Commission of Independence will find
the following facts:


   "That there exist likewise in the Philippines all the conditions
    of stability and guarantees for law and order that Cuba had to
    establish to the satisfaction of America in order to obtain her
    independence, or to preserve it, during the military occupation of
    1898-1902 and during the intervention of 1906-1909, respectively.

   "That the 'preparation for independence' and the 'stable
    government' required by President Wilson and the Congress of the
    United States, respectively, contain no new requisite not included
    in any of the cases above cited.

   "That these prerequisites for Philippine Independence are the
    same as those virtually or expressly established by the Republican
    administration that preceded President Wilson's administration.

   "That during the entire time that the Filipino people have been
    with America, they have been living in the confidence that the
    American occupation was only temporary and that its final aim
    was not aggrandizement or conquest, but the peace, welfare,
    and liberty of the Filipino people.

   "That this faith in the promises of America was a cardinal factor
    not only in the coöperation between Americans and Filipinos during
    the years of peace, but also in the coöperation between Americans
    and Filipinos during the late war.

   "That the condition of thorough development of the internal
    affairs of the country and the present international atmosphere
    of justice, liberty, and security for all peoples, are the most
    propitious for the fulfillment by America of her promises and
    for her redemption of the pledges she has made before the world.

   "Therefore, so far as it is humanly possible to judge
    and say, we can see only one aim for the Commission of
    Independence--independence; and we can give only one
    instruction--to get it. * * *"


The Mission proceeded to Washington to confer with President Wilson and
to make known their desires. It happened, however, that the President
was in Paris, at the Peace Conference, and could not receive the
mission in person. He delegated Secretary of War Baker to represent
him and to read for him to the Mission a letter in which he expressed
sentiments of sympathy and good will. In that letter, the President
said in part:


   "I am sorry that I cannot look into the faces of the gentlemen
    of this Mission from the Philippine Islands and tell them all
    that I have in mind and heart as I think of the patient labor,
    with the end almost in sight, undertaken by the American and
    Filipino people for their permanent benefit. I know, however,
    that your sentiments are mine in this regard and that you will
    translate truly to them my own feelings."


And Secretary Baker, on his part, said:


   "I know that I express the feeling of the President--I certainly
    express my own feeling; I think I express the prevailing feeling
    in the United States--when I say that we believe the time has
    substantially come, if not quite come, when the Philippine Islands
    can be allowed to sever the mere formal political tie remaining
    and become an independent people."


Hearing Before Congressional Committee.--Because of the absence of
President Wilson, the mission had to return to the Islands with its
object unattained. The members, however, had visited many cities of the
United States and delivered speeches pleading for independence. They
also succeeded in getting a hearing before a joint-committee
of Congress, presided over by the then Senator Harding. But the
committee was adverse to any action being taken at the time on the
issue of Philippine independence and so stated. The Mission then
presented a memorial "to the Senate and House of Representatives of
the United States," wherein it submitted the case of the Filipinos
in substance thus:


1.  That as defined and established in the Act of Congress of August
    29, 1916, the purpose of the Government of the United States is
    to withdraw its sovereignty over the Philippine Islands as soon
    as a stable government can be established therein.

2.  That in accordance with the terms and provisions of said law,
    the people of the Philippines have organized a government that
    has been in operation for nearly three years and which has
    offered complete evidence that conditions are ripe for the
    establishment of an independent government that will be fully
    capable of maintaining law and order, administer justice, promote
    the welfare of all the inhabitants of the islands, and discharge
    as well its international obligations.

3.  That the Filipino people desire their independence at this time,
    and along with that independence, they confidently hope to
    preserve the bonds of good understanding and friendship which bind
    them to the United States, and to foster the free development of
    commercial relations between the two countries.


The Second Mission.--The first Mission failing to get independence,
a second one was dispatched in 1922, with identically the same
purpose--to negotiate for independence. It was designated a
Parliamentary Mission, presided over by the Speaker of the House and
the President of the Senate, and was composed of 14 members. Arriving
at Washington, it presented a memorial to President Harding, which, in
point of logic, force, earnestness, and diction, must stand unique in
the annals of peoples aspiring to be free through peaceful methods. It
is the case of the Filipinos in a nutshell. It recites in part:


    MEMORIAL OF JUNE 16, 1922

   "Mr. President: With the deepest sense of loyalty and confidence
    in the American people, the Philippine Legislature has decided to
    send the present Parliamentary Mission to the United States. The
    Mission brings a message of good-will and friendship from the
    Filipino people to the people of the United States, and is charged
    to resume the negotiations for the independence of the Philippines
    begun by the first Mission sent in 1919.


    MCKINLEY AND ROOT'S DEFINITION OF STABLE GOVERNMENT

   "There are, in President McKinley's estimate, two main elements
    in a stable government: First, ability to maintain order and
    insure peace and tranquility, and the security of citizens;
    second, ability to observe international obligations. To those
    two elements, Mr. Root in his instruction for the Cuban people,
    added the following: It must rest upon the peaceful suffrages of
    the people and must contain constitutional limitations to protect
    the people from the arbitrary actions of the Government. All
    these elements are to be found in the Philippines today.


    PRESENT PHILIPPINE GOVERNMENT SATISFIES ALL CONDITIONS

   "It is admitted by the Wood-Forbes Mission that order has been
    properly maintained and that our Insular police or constabulary,
    "has proved itself to be dependable and thoroughly efficient. *
    * * They are naturally an orderly people."

   "The Filipino people are by nature and tradition hospitable
    and courteous to foreigners. There has been no anti-foreign
    agitation or outbreak. The business of foreigners has been amply
    protected and will continue to be so protected under an independent
    Philippines. During the short-lived Philippine Republic prisoners
    of war were treated according to the law of nations, and there
    was security for foreigners.


    ORDERLY ELECTIONS

   "The Insular, provincial, and municipal governments of the
    Philippines rest on the free and peaceful suffrage of the
    people. The people elect members of the Insular legislature,
    provincial governors, members of the provincial boards, municipal
    presidents, and members of the municipal councils. Interest in
    the elections is widespread and election day passes without any
    serious disturbances. There was a general, quiet acceptance by
    the minority of the results of the popular vote. * * *


    CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES

   "The structure and workings of our government also conform
    to the standard defined by Mr. Root in that it is "subject
    to the limitations and safeguards which the experience of
    a constitutional government has shown to be necessary to the
    preservation of individual rights." The Filipino people fought for
    such constitutional safeguards during the Spanish régime. A modern
    bill of rights was inserted in the Constitution of the Philippine
    Republic. Our present constitutional limitations and safeguards
    have been in operation since 1900 when President McKinley in
    his instructions to the second Philippine Commission set down
    as inviolable rules the fundamental provisions of the American
    Bill of Rights. These provisions with slight modification were
    later included in the Organic Act of 1902, and again set forth
    in the Jones Law of 1916. For more than twenty years, therefore,
    the Philippine Government has been subject to constitutional
    practices. They are imbedded in the political life of the people,
    and no matter what political change may occur in the Philippines
    they will find no material alteration. An impartial judiciary is
    there to enforce them.


    COMPETENT JUDICIARY

   "The Supreme Court has the respect and confidence of the Filipino
    people. The courts of First Instance, mostly presided over by
    Filipinos ever since 1914, have maintained a standard which,
    in general, compares favorably with the state courts of the
    Union. From August 31, 1912, to September 1, 1913, during the
    last two years of Governor Forbes' administration, only 25.1 per
    cent of the decisions appealed from these courts were reversed by
    the Supreme Court. From March 3, 1919, to March 4, 1921, another
    period of two years with Filipinos in control, the percentage
    of reversals decreased to 20.8 per cent. The number of cases
    disposed of by the Courts of First Instance for the eight years
    (1906 to 1913, inclusive) was as many as 82,528. The total number
    of cases disposed of for the same length of time, with Filipinos
    in greater control (1914 to 1921, inclusive), was 117,357 or an
    increase of 34,829, or 42 per cent.


    GENERAL PROGRESS

   "Philippine autonomy has also increased the agencies of social
    and political progress, such as schools, roads, public buildings,
    hospitals, etc. In 1913, when the Filipino people had even less
    share in the government than they have now, there were enrolled
    in public schools 440,050 pupils, in 1921 there were nearly a
    million (943,422). In 1913, there were only 2,934 public schools;
    in 1920 there were 5,944. In 1913, there were 2,171 kilometers of
    first-class roads in operation, in 1921 the figure was 4,698.8
    in addition to about 5,000 kilometers of second-class roads. In
    1913, there were no dispensaries where the poor could be given
    medical treatment; in 1921, there were over 800. In 1913 the
    appropriation for medical aid to the poor was P1,548,371.25;
    in 1921 the sum was P3,153,828.00.

   "Social and economic progress has also been tremendous during
    this period. In 1913 there were hardly a dozen women's clubs,
    in 1921 there were 342 in active work. In 1913, the volume of
    Philippine commerce was only P202,171,484, in 1920 it swelled to
    P601,124,276. The cultivated area in 1913 was 2,361,483 hectares
    as compared with 3,276,942 hectares in 1920, or 38.7 per cent
    increase. The present conditions in the Philippines compare
    favorably with those existing in many nations whose right to
    national sovereignty is not in the least questioned.


    THE FAVORABLE INTERNATIONAL SITUATION

   "Three years ago the impression of the members of the first
    Philippine Mission was that the main objection in the minds of
    many Americans to the immediate independence of the Philippines
    was the danger of foreign aggression. While this is entirely
    outside of the question as to whether we have complied with the
    requirements of the Jones Law, it may not be amiss to call the
    attention of those Americans to the great change in international
    affairs which has taken place since the visit of the last Mission.


    THE WASHINGTON CONFERENCE

   "Wholesome relationship has especially been established in the
    Pacific area. The recent Washington Conference has cleared away
    many doubts and misgivings.

   "In the words of the President of the United States that conference
    was called 'to provide some means whereby just, thoughtful,
    righteous peoples, who are not seeking to seize something which
    does not belong to them can live peaceably together and eliminate
    cause of conflict.'"


    IRELAND, EGYPT, AND INDIA

   "To the favorable international atmosphere may be added the fact
    that the first of colonial powers is already reversing her former
    policies. She has granted recognition of freedom and equality to
    peoples hitherto held as subjects and vassals. Egypt has regained
    her independence. The Irish people have been asked to enter into
    an agreement with England, looking to the establishment of a free
    state. Liberal institutions are now being established in India.


    TRIUMPH OF AMERICAN IDEALS

   "We see in all these events the gradual triumph of American ideals,
    especially of that fundamental American principle that declares
    that governments derive their just powers from the consent of
    the governed.

   "Hence we come to America in the full expectation that the
    United States can do no less than other nations have done to
    their dependencies; that she cannot now refrain from practicing
    those principles which were initiated by her and followed by her
    sister nations; that she cannot now refuse specific realization
    of those purposes and ideals, which found eloquent expression
    in her spokesmen both in times of war and in times of peaceful
    reconstruction; and that she will make the Filipino people a
    determining factor in the relationship that should exist between
    the United States and the only unincorporated and subject country
    now under the American flag.


    MISSION HAS FULL POWERS

   "We, therefore, submit our case, with faith and confidence,
    frankly and without evasion. It is the case of the Filipino
    people whom in fact and in law we represent, for certainly
    under the present circumstances no other agency can speak or
    act with as much authority on what the Filipino people want or
    on Philippine conditions in general, as their duly accredited
    representatives. That is the very essence of representative
    government."


President Harding replied after due deliberation, stating that he
was not yet ready to recommend the concession of independence to
Congress, but assured the members of the Mission and, thru them, the
Filipino people, that there would be no backward step taken during
his administration, and that the autonomy now enjoyed by the Filipinos
would remain unimpaired.

Petition for a constitutional convention.--The second Mission,
failing in its object like the first, the Philippine Legislature at
its next session in 1922, set about to devise other means whereby
action on the question of independence could be hastened. After days
of stirring debate, it was decided to ask Congress for permission
to call a Constitutional Convention to draft a Constitution for a
Philippine Republic, and the following resolution was passed:


   "Whereas, the people and government of the United States have
    solemnly promised to grant independence as soon as a stable
    government can be established in the Philippines; and

   "Whereas, a stable government now exists and is now in operation
    with the necessary guarantees that insure success, permanency,
    and security; and

   "Whereas, preparation and approval by legitimate representatives of
    the Filipino people of a political constitution for the Philippines
    is, in the sense of the legislature, a proper and efficacious
    step for the securing of Philippine independence; therefore, be it

   "Resolved, by the Philippine Senate, with the concurrence of the
    House of Representatives, that the United States Congress be asked,
    as it is hereby asked, to authorize the Philippine Legislature
    to make arrangements for the holding of a general election for
    the selection of delegates to a constitutional assembly which
    shall have the duty of preparing, discussing, and adopting a
    political constitution for an independent Philippine Republic; of
    determining, with the government of the United States, what kind
    of relationship, if any, should exist between said government of
    the United States and the Philippines; and finally of prescribing
    the election by the people of the Philippines of officials that
    shall exercise the authority and functions prescribed by the
    constitution to be adopted and to whom the present government of
    the Philippines shall be transferred as soon as they have legally
    assumed their posts."


This resolution is now before the Congress of the United States,
awaiting action by that body.

Double fare may be charged between one and five o'clock
antemeridian. Drivers shall not be compelled to carry passengers
beyond the city limits.

In the smaller towns and in the country the hiring of a vehicle,
like most commercial transactions, is a matter of bargain. The proper
fare depends very largely on the state of the road and the chance of
securing a return passenger, and therefore varies very greatly. The
customary rate over a frequently traveled route can usually be learned
by consulting some disinterested person, preferably an American. In
every case the amount to be paid should be settled in advance.

Money orders may also be purchased, payable in some thirty-five other
foreign countries and dependencies. Information regarding the fees
will be furnished by the post-master at any money-order office. No
order is issued for a sum greater than one hundred dollars ($100),
United States currency.

(h) Under the present customs laws, all goods which are the growth,
product, or manufacture of the United States, the Philippine Islands,
or of both, or which do not contain foreign materials to the value
of more than 20 per cent of their total value, are, with certain
exceptions, admitted free of duty when mailed from the Islands to
the United States. The only exceptions of importance to travelers are
cigars and cigarettes, which are subject to a fine equivalent to the
duty, if sent by mail. In order to assure the free entry of other
mail shipments, every package worth less than P20 should have its
true value and the fact that it comes within the limits just defined,
certified to by the sender on the wrapper. Packages whose value is
P20 or more require a certificate of origin, which can be issued only
by the Collector of Customs at a port of entry. In Manila, however,
a customs official is on duty at the central post office at certain
hours to issue these documents. The certificate must be pasted in the
wrapper or be placed in an envelope to the package. If the shipment
is valued at P50 or more, a fee of P2 is charged for the certificate.

(i) Rates for telegrams over the government lines:

For ordinary message, P0.06 per word, including address and signature.

For rush messages, P0.12 per word.

For repeated messages, one-half more than the regular rate.

(j) Rates for cablegrams over the most important private lines
from Manila:

To the United States (Continental): Eastern Extension, Australasia,
and China Telegraph Company, P3.48 to P3.66 per word, according
to locality.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
